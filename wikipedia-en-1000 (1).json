["Joseph Greenberg\n\nJoseph Harold Greenberg (May 28, 1915 \u2013 May 7, 2001) was an American linguist, known mainly for his work concerning linguistic typology and the genetic classification of languages.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life and education \n\nJoseph Greenberg was born on May 28, 1915 to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.\n\nAfter finishing high school, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at Columbia University in New York. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by Franz Boas concerning American Indian languages. With references from Boas and Ruth Benedict, he was accepted as a graduate student by Melville J. Herskovits at Northwestern University in Chicago. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the Hausa people of Nigeria, where he learned the Hausa language. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of Islam on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.\n\nDuring 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at Yale University. These were interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, for which he worked as a codebreaker and participated with the landing at Casablanca. Before leaving for Europe during 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia University.\n\nCareer\nAfter the war, Greenberg taught at the University of Minnesota before returning to Columbia University during 1948 as a teacher of anthropology. While in New York, he became acquainted with Roman Jakobson and Andr\u00e9 Martinet. They introduced him to the Prague school of structuralism, which influenced his work.\n\nDuring 1962, Greenberg relocated to the anthropology department of Stanford University in California, where he continued to work for the rest of his life. During 1965 Greenberg served as president of the African Studies Association. He received during 1996 the highest award for a scholar in Linguistics, the Gold Medal of Philology.\n\nContributions to linguistics\n\nLinguistic typology \n\nGreenberg's reputation rests partly on his contributions to synchronic linguistics and the quest to identify linguistic universals. During the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.\n\nIn particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of \"implicational universal\", which has the form, \"if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y.\" For example, X might be \"mid front rounded vowels\" and Y \"high front rounded vowels\" (for terminology see phonetics). Many scholars adopted this kind of research following Greenberg's example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.\n\nLike Noam Chomsky, Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures on which human language is based. Unlike Chomsky, Greenberg's method was functionalist, rather than formalist. An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan methods can be found in Linguistic Universals (2006), edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil .\n\nMany who are strongly opposed to Greenberg's methods of language classification (see below) acknowledge the importance of his typological work. During 1963 he published an article that was extremely influential: \"Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements\".\n\nMass comparison \n\nGreenberg rejected the opinion, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that comparative reconstruction was the only method to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: one cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until one knows which languages to compare (1957:44).\n\nHe also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time (which commonly take years to perform) could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,749,027,089,305,918,018 ways (1957:44). For comparison, the Niger\u2013Congo family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.\n\nGreenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared (to basic vocabulary, morphology, and known paths of sound change) and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned (1957:39).\n\nGreenberg used the premise that mass \"borrowing\" of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters \"in certain semantic areas\", making it easy to detect (1957:39). With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.\n\nGreenberg first termed his method \"mass comparison\" in an article of 1954 (reprinted in Greenberg 1955). As of 1987, he replaced the term \"mass comparison\" with \"multilateral comparison\", to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step (Greenberg, 1957:44). According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification (Greenberg, 1957:45).\n\nMost historical linguists (Campbell 2001:45) reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been Lyle Campbell, Donald Ringe, William Poser, and the late R. Larry Trask.\n\nGenetic classification of languages\n\nLanguages of Africa \n\nGreenberg is known widely for his development of a classification system for the languages of Africa, which he published as a series of articles in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology from 1949 to 1954 (reprinted together as a book, The Languages of Africa, in 1955). He revised the book and published it again during 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition of 1966 (reprinted without change during 1970). A few more changes of the classification were made by Greenberg in an article during 1981.\n\nGreenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger\u2013Congo, and Khoisan. During the course of his work, Greenberg invented the term \"Afroasiatic\" to replace the earlier term \"Hamito-Semitic\", after showing that the Hamitic group, accepted widely since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to establish the classification of the Bantu languages, which occupy much of sub-Saharan Africa, as a part of the Niger\u2013Congo family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.\n\nGreenberg's classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan language family. Now, apart from Khoisan, it is generally accepted by African specialists and has been used as a basis for further work by other scholars.\n\nGreenberg's work on African languages has been criticised by Lyle Campbell and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data and request a re-examination of his macro-phyla by \"reliable methods\" (Ringe 1993:104). Harold Fleming and Lionel Bender, who were sympathetic to Greenberg's classification, acknowledged that at least some of his macrofamilies (particularly the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoisan macrofamiles) are not accepted completely by most linguists and may need to be divided (Campbell 1997). Their objection was methodological: if mass comparison is not a valid method, it cannot be expected to have brought order successfully out of the confusion of African languages.\n\nBy contrast, some linguists have sought to combine Greenberg's four African families into larger units. In particular, Edgar Gregersen (1972) proposed joining Niger\u2013Congo and Nilo-Saharan into a larger family, which he termed Kongo-Saharan. Roger Blench (1995) suggests Niger\u2013Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.\n\nThe languages of New Guinea, Tasmania, and the Andaman Islands\n\nDuring 1971 Greenberg proposed the Indo-Pacific macrofamily, which groups together the Papuan languages (a large number of language families of New Guinea and nearby islands) with the native languages of the Andaman Islands and Tasmania but excludes the Australian Aboriginal languages. Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the Austronesian languages, which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of people.\n\nGreenberg's subgrouping of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of Stephen Wurm (1982) and Malcolm Ross (2005) has provided considerable evidence for his once-radical idea that these languages form a single genetic unit. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and Timor\u2013Alor families \"are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances.\" He believes this to be due to a linguistic substratum.\n\nThe languages of the Americas\n\nMost linguists concerned with the native languages of the Americas classify them into 150 to 180 independent language families. Some believe that two language families, Eskimo\u2013Aleut and Na-Den\u00e9, were distinct, perhaps the results of later migrations into the New World.\n\nEarly on, Greenberg (1957:41, 1960) became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book Language in the Americas, while agreeing that the Eskimo\u2013Aleut and Na-Den\u00e9 groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed Amerind.\n\nLanguage in the Americas has generated lively debate, but has been criticized strongly; it is rejected by most specialists of indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists of the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenberg's data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.\n\nHistorical linguists also reject the validity of the method of multilateral (or mass) comparison upon which the classification is based. They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.\n\nHowever, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenberg's Amerind classification: the \u201cFirst American\u201d category. \u201cThe cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.\u201d Nevertheless, this category of \u201cFirst American\u201d people also interbred with and contributed a significant amount of genes to the ancestors of both Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Den\u00e9 populations, with 60% and 90% \"First American\" DNA respectively constituting the genetic makeup of the two groups.\n\nThe languages of northern Eurasia \n\nLater in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern Eurasia belong to a single higher-order family, which he termed Eurasiatic. The only exception was Yeniseian, which has been related to a wider Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian grouping, also including Sino-Tibetan.  During 2008 Edward Vajda related Yeniseian to the Na-Den\u00e9 languages of North America as a Den\u00e9\u2013Yeniseian family.\n\nThe Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older Nostratic groupings of Holger Pedersen and Vladislav Illich-Svitych by including Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic. It differs by including Nivkh, Japonic, Korean, and Ainu (which the Nostraticists had excluded from comparison because they are single languages rather than language families) and in excluding Afroasiatic. At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably Sergei Starostin, constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly larger than Greenberg's grouping but it also excluded Afroasiatic.\n\nRecently, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).\n\nThe American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic, alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian. Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to any other language family. Sergei Starostin's school has now included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic. They reserve the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping, which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise inclusion of Dravidian and Kartvelian.\n\nGreenberg continued to work on this project after he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer and until he died during May 2001. His colleague and former student Merritt Ruhlen ensured the publication of the final volume of his Eurasiatic work (2002) after his death.\n\nSelected works by Joseph H.

She studied with Clara Lichtenstein (no relation) at Royal Victoria College, part of McGill University. In 1902, went to the Conservatoire de Paris on a grant from Donald Smith, Lord Strathcona, the patron of RVC.  There, she studied voice with Edmond Duvernoy.  She adopted the stage name Donalda in honour of her patron.\n\nCareer\nWith the help of composer Jules Massenet, Donalda made her debut in 1904 in Nice, singing the title role in his opera Manon.  The following year, she debuted in London, singing the role of Mica\u00ebla in Carmen. Donalda was the first to sing the roles of Concepci\u00f3n in Maurice Ravel's L'heure espagnole and Ah-joe in Franco Leoni's L'Oracolo at Covent Garden. In November 1906, she returned to Montreal to sing in a recital at the Montreal Arena with her new husband, baritone Paul Seveilhac. The following month, she began a season with Oscar Hammerstein's new Manhattan Opera House. She returned to Europe in 1907, singing principally in London and Paris.\n\nDonalda was in Canada when World War I broke out.  She chose to remain in the country, singing in concerts and music halls, with occasional appearances in New York and Boston. In Montreal, she organized the Donalda Sunday Afternoon Concerts, donating the proceeds to war charities.  She returned to Paris in 1917, and married her second husband, Mischa L\u00e9on, there the following year.\n\nIn 1922, Donalda opened a teaching studio in Paris where she taught many students over the next few years. She moved back to Montreal in 1937 and opened a studio there. Her students in Montreal included Robert Savoie. She founded the Opera Guild of Montreal in 1942, serving as president and artistic director until 1969.\n\nIn 1967, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \"for her contribution to the arts, especially opera, as a singer and founder of the Opera Guild in Montreal.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The Virtual Gramophone's Pauline Lightstone Donalda biography\n portrait\n\nCategory:1882 births\nCategory:1970 deaths\nCategory:Canadian female singers\nCategory:Canadian operatic sopranos\nCategory:Jewish Canadian musicians\nCategory:Musicians from Montreal\nCategory:Officers of the Order of Canada\nCategory:20th-century opera singers\nCategory:20th-century women singers", "List of German football transfers summer 2017\n\nThis is a list of German football transfers in the summer transfer window 2017 by club.

In the 2007\u201308 season, Hudson recorded the only quadruple-double in NCAA Division I men's basketball history. At the conclusion of the season, he declared himself for the 2008 NBA draft, but later withdrew. Hudson was drafted by the Boston Celtics with the 58th pick of the 2009 NBA draft, but was later waived. He was then signed by the Memphis Grizzlies. Hudson later played for the Washington Wizards and Cleveland Cavaliers before returning to the Grizzlies in April 2012.\n\nCollege career\nHudson put together one of the best all-around seasons in Ohio Valley Conference history in 2007\u201308 and helped UT Martin make a six-game improvement in its league record from the previous year. The Skyhawks were picked last (11th) in a preseason poll but finished fourth and qualified for the OVC Tournament. \n\nHudson made school, conference and NCAA history during the season, including becoming the first Division I men's player to record a quadruple-double (25 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals vs. Central Baptist College) in a college game on November 13, 2007. (Counting Ann Meyers' 1978 quadruple-double for UCLA, at a time when women's college sports were governed by the AIAW instead of the NCAA, five women have recorded quadruple-doubles in NCAA Division I women's play, the most recent being Shakyla Hill of Grambling State on February 2nd, 2018.\n\nHe also had a triple-double, eight additional double-doubles and cracked the 30-point plateau 11 times during his rookie season in the league. He finished the season ranked fifth nationally in points per game (25.7); fourth in steals (2.8) and tenth in 3-pointers made per game (3.8). He also ranked among the top 90 nationally in each rebounding (79th, 7.8/game), assists (88th, 4.5/game), 3-point percentage (72nd, 38.8%) and free throw percentage (67th, 83.4%). \n\nA Memphis, Tennessee native who transferred from Southwest Tennessee Community College, Hudson is the first UT Martin player to receive the OVC Player of the Year award. He was again honored in the 2008\u201309 season, the first back to back win since Murray State University's Marcus Brown won in the 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 seasons.  He was also named to the OVC All-Newcomer squad, became just the fourth Skyhawk ever named to the All-OVC first-team (2007\u20132008 and 2008\u20132009,) and was named UT Martin's Bob Carroll Male Athlete of the Year. \n\nWith All-American honors from the Associated Press and Collegeinsider.com, Hudson became the first player in UT Martin history to claim the honors since the school started playing in Division I.\n\nProfessional career\nOver the first few months of the 2009\u201310 season, Hudson split time between the Celtics and their NBADL affiliate, the Maine Red Claws. On January 2, an injury ravaged Celtics team turned to Hudson during a game against the Toronto Raptors. On January 6, 2010, Hudson was waived by the Celtics, but he was claimed by the Memphis Grizzlies two days later. The Grizzlies assigned him to the Dakota Wizards of the D-League on February 28, 2010.\n\nHudson was waived on July 1, 2010 by the Grizzlies.\n\nHe played for the Washington Wizards during the NBA's 2010 summer league.\n\nHudson was invited to Wizards' training camp for the 2010\u201311 NBA season and made the team. After playing six games for them, he was waived on November 23, 2010. He was re-signed on December 20, 2010, but waived again on January 5, 2011.\n\nIn January 2011 he signed with the Guangdong Southern Tigers in China. He joined Qingdao DoubleStar in November 2011.\n\nOn March 30, 2012, Hudson was signed by the Cleveland Cavaliers to the first of two \n10-day contracts. He quickly established himself, scoring at least 23 points in three consecutive games from April 6 to April 10. He also hit two last-second shots to force two games into overtime. On April 20, 2012, after his second 10-day contract expired, he joined the Memphis Grizzlies for the remainder of the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nOn October 12, 2012, he signed with the Dongguan Leopards of China. On March 15, 2013, he was acquired by the Austin Toros of the NBA D-League.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, he signed with the Utah Jazz. He was later waived by the Jazz on October 26. In November 2013, he signed with Xinjiang Flying Tigers. \n\nOn October 14, 2014, he signed with the Liaoning Flying Leopards for the 2014\u201315 CBA season.\n\nOn March 29, 2015, Hudson signed a 10-day contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. On April 11, he signed a multi-year deal with the Clippers.

Andress' bikini arrived at a key moment in the history of women's fashion, coming at the \"birth of the sexual revolution\": the 1960s.\n\nIn the corresponding scene of the original novel, the character Honeychile Rider wears only a leather belt with a scabbard, and no bikini.\n\nDesign \n\nAndress designed the bikini along with Dr. Nos costume designer Tessa Prendergast, whom she first met while living in Rome. Andress reported that when she arrived in Jamaica for filming, no costumes were ready. She worked with director Terence Young and the costume designer to create something that fit her 5'6\", 36\u201324\u201336 frame. It was made from ivory cotton and was the only one made and worn by her. It is a white belted bikini.\n\nReception \n\nThe Dr. No bikini is cited as the best known bikini of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history. The moment in which Andress emerges from the sea in the white bikini has been cited amongst the greatest moments in film and one of its most erotic; in a 2003 UK Survey by Channel 4, it was voted number one in \"the 100 Greatest Sexy Moments\" of cinema. The scene has been widely emulated and parodied on screen since. The white bikini is regarded as perhaps the most important in the history of the bikini and sales of the two-piece bikini rocketed after the appearance of Andress in Dr. No. In a survey of 1000 women to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the bikini, Ursula Andress in her white bikini was voted \"The Ultimate Bikini Goddess\". Andress said that she owed her career to that white bikini, remarking, \"This bikini made me into a success. As a result of starring in Dr. No as the first Bond girl, I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent.\" Andress auctioned the bikini through Christie's auction house in London, selling it for \u00a335,000 in 2001, less than the \u00a340,000 it had been expected to sell for.\n\nHomage \n\nThe bikini and scene in Dr. No of Andress emerging from the water was emulated by Heather Graham in a scene from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. It has also been emulated by Halle Berry, who wore an orange bikini with a toolbelt in the 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day.\n\nWhen Daniel Craig took over the role of James Bond in the 2006 film Casino Royale, he appeared in a similar scene, emerging from the ocean wearing only a pale blue pair of swim trunks. This thirteen-second shot, focused on Bond's body rather than that of a Bond Girl, was widely interpreted as a callback to Andress in Dr. No and featured heavily in the film's promotion, although Craig claims the resemblance did not occur to him until it was filmed.\n\nSee also \n History of the bikini\n Bikini in popular culture\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:1960s fashion\nCategory:1962 clothing\nCategory:Dr. No (film)\nCategory:Individual bikinis", "Cellana radians\n\nCellana radians, common name the radiate limpet, is a species of true limpet, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Nacellidae, which is one of the true limpet families.\n\nDescription\nThe foot and the head are lightly colored whereas Cellana flava has darker colored soft tissues.

JNA was founded in 1988 in memory of late avid amateur radio operator, Jamshed N. Anklesaria (callsign: VU2JNA) who died in 1987. The organisation, currently headed by Sudhir Shah (VU2SVS) conducts classes and organises scramble teams to tackle disasters.\n\nHistory\nThe organisation was formed in 1988, in memory of Jamshed N. Anklesaria who died after suffering a heart-attack in 1987. Anklesaria was a bachelor who invested much of his time amateur radio, and radio equipment. After his death, instead of selling off the equipment, Anklesaria's brother requested current secretary, to perpetuate Jamshed's memory. Shah, along with P Venkatraman and a few others then started the JNA Wireless Association with the equipment donated by Jamshed's brother. The JNA has since then organised several classes and handled disasters around the city.\n\nClasses\nJNA has been conducting amateur radio classes in Mumbai for over ten years. After a brief lull, JNA restarted its amateur radio classes in 2008, with two batches held at Malabar Hill and Vile Parle.\n\nDisaster management\nJNA has its own dedicated 70-member scrambler team and has a long history in handling disaster management. In 1993, JNA set up the first communication station at Killari, the epicenter of the 1993 Latur earthquake that killed 8,000.  Headed by Sudhir Shah, JNA provided live communication between Killari and the state headquarters at Mantralaya in Mumbai. It broadcast messages relating to the extent of damage, extent of the calamity, and other life-saving messages.\n\nIn 2008, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) included JNA as part of its disaster management operations to provide emergency communication support during the monsoons to provide live updates on the flooding situation in the city. Five stations were set up at Nana Chowk, Milan Subway, Kalina, Santacruz, and Chembur and were linked up to the main control centre at the BMC headquarters at Fort. In addition, another station, manned by Sha was set up at Malabar Hill with the help of the Malabar Hill Residents Association.\n\nSee also\nAmateur radio in India\nMumbai Amateur Radio Society\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nhttp://members.tripod.com/~VU2JNA/ \u2013 Official website\nJNA BMC - MOM of 16 June 2006 meeting \u2013 setting up of JNA stations.\n\nCategory:Amateur radio organisations in India\nCategory:Organisations based in Mumbai\nCategory:1988 establishments in India\nCategory:Organizations established in 1988", "Arabic Numeral Series\n\nThe Arabic Numeral Series, sometimes referred to as the Arabics, is a series of 19 short 16mm films  completed by the American experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage in 1981 and 1982. The Arabic Numeral Series gets its name from the fact that none of the films included in it have titles, instead opening with an arabic numeral. Brakhage produced another cycle, the Roman Numeral Series, whose films all have Roman numerals instead of titles, around the same time. All of the Arabics are silent and are intended to be projected at 18 frames per second.\n\nWriting in a 1997 introduction to a screening of the complete cycle, film critic Fred Camper referred to the Arabics as being the \"richest\" of the filmmaker's 1980s cycles, explaining: \"With some exceptions, the Arabics take the idea of the void as their ground. That is, the light we do see almost always seems to be set against darkness, or occasionally against white, these momentary flickers that materialize tenuously out of emptiness. But the darkness is not 'night,' or even simply some more abstract absence of light, but a more profound vacuum: it represents a world stripped of all the coordinates of the known, an unmeasurable absence. [...] These lushly sensual, pleasurable-to-view films are also terrifying: their unpredictability, continually enacting new dramas of surprise, alternatively swamps the viewer in light and leaves him adrift in darkness. \"\n\nFilms\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:American films\nCategory:American independent films\nCategory:Films directed by Stan Brakhage", "No Stranger to Danger (Payolas album)\n\nNo Stranger to Danger is the second album by the Payolas, released in 1982.

The western edge defines the eastern extent of the Wissembourg Gap, a corridor of open terrain between the Bienwald and the hills of the Palatine Forest.  In the northwest, the forest is bounded by the so-called \"Cattle Line\" (), running from Schweighofen to Kandel.  In the north, the forest reaches as far as Hatzenb\u00fchl and Rheinzabern.  The eastern boundary largely runs along the bank of the Rhine from Jockgrim to Hagenbach and Berg (Pfalz).  The southern boundary follows the valley of the Lauter along the border of France and Germany.  The bulk of the forest belongs to the municipality of W\u00f6rth am Rhein.  At its greatest extent, the Bienwald is approximately  wide along its east\u2013west axis and  from north to south.  The forest has an area of some .  Approximately one-third of the forest is deciduous woodland with the remainder coniferous.  The forest has an elevation of  above sea level by the Rhine, and rises to  above sea level in its western extremities.\n\nThe only settlement in the Bienwald is B\u00fcchelberg (940 inhabitants as of 2015), which lies inside a clearing in the forest and is administratively part of the town of W\u00f6rth am Rhein.\n\nOn 13 August 1793, a battle of the War of the First Coalition took place in the Bienwald.  Austrian troops under Marshal Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser pushed the French Army back and frustrated the relief of Mainz.  In March 1945, during World War II, the U.S. VI Corps and the French First Army assaulted German Siegfried Line fortifications in the Bienwald and penetrated German defenses in the forest during a week of heavy combat.  The forest is still marked by trenches and bunker ruins from World War II.  There are also older French earthworks (redoutes) in the southwestern parts of the forest where it borders the Lauter river and Mundat Forest ().\n\nThe proposed construction of a multi-lane controlled access highway through the forest is disputed. The proposed road would connect the French A35 autoroute and the German A65 autobahn.\n\nEuropean wildcats have taken up residence in the Bienwald in the last few years, often using the ruins of destroyed bunkers for shelter.\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:Forests and woodlands of Rhineland-Palatinate\nCategory:Geography of the Palatinate (region)\nCategory:South Palatinate\nCategory:Landscapes of Rhineland-Palatinate", "Gyakuten!

He spent much of his free time painting commission portraits and working on Interior Design projects for clientele. It was in his free time that Caldwell began making installation furniture for his Interior Design projects. In the fall of 2008, Benjamin quit his job at Votivo and opened his own studio, BRC Designs in January 2009 where he released his first furniture line.\n\nPersonal life\nBenjamin Rollins Caldwell married Charlotte Whitaker Filbert in May 2013 in a private ceremony at the Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Florida.\n\nWork\nBenjamin Rollins Caldwell opened his studio, BRC Designs, in January 2009 in Spartanburg, South Carolina.  It was here at BRC Designs, that Ben released his first piece of furniture the suspended Birdseye Bed.  Soon followed his first furniture line that included the Dueces Wild Chair, which really put Caldwell into the spotlight.  Caldwell showcased his Binary Collection at Design Miami during Art Basel in December 2013.\n\nCollections\nPockets Rug Collection (Spring 2011): Jean pockets are sewn together to form a patchwork rug.\n\nAbc123 (Spring 2011): Composed entirely of children's building blocks, The ABC123 furniture collection was designed with the intention of inspiring children to create and build things out of objects that they are surrounded by.\n\nBALLISTIC Collection (Spring 2011): .22 caliber rounds have been shot randomly into the bullet resistant surface of the Ballistic collection pieces creating unique explosive patterns. At first glance the pieces appear to be a surrealistic representation of a school of jellyfish but upon closer inspection one will notice the metal shots radiating from the bullet's point of impact. Composed entirely of 1.25\u201d level 3 bullet resistant laminate acrylic. The Ballistic Chair is outfitted with Kevlar seat cushions.\n\nBINARY Collection (Spring/Fall 2011): Inspired by pallets of obsolete computers and electronics that were collecting dust in a local warehouse. The understructure of each piece in the Binary Collection is made from the metal from computer towers and from printers that are riveted together and bent to the proper form. The surface is completely covered with a collage of motherboards, computer chips, LED screens and hard drive disks held in place by sheet metal screws. The glass from the table was salvaged from an abandoned warehouse. The seats of the chairs are made from Ethernet and ribbon cables which have been woven together.\n\nThe American Pipe Dream (Spring 2012): With copper prices at an all-time high, theft of copper has become a growing problem. Caldwell became frustrated after a thief stripped the copper out of one of his welding machines; Completely destroying the expensive machine for a couple dollars worth of copper, most likely for the theft's next drug fix. The American Pipe Dream Collection is a response to these crimes. Composed of half inch copper piping, which has been soldered together in a maze-like method inspired by the windows computer pipe screen savor.\n\nCAPPED OUT (Fall 2012): Thousands of colorful repurposed Soda Bottle Caps are attached together using zips ties to a powder coated steel form, creating the unique shapes of the Capped Out pieces. The steel understructure of each piece in the collection is composed of 98% recycled steel content, finished with an environmentally responsibly applied powder coating. Six evenly spaced holes are drilled into each soda cap, then a ziptie is threaded through the holes, connecting each soda cap together, and through repetition, creating a strong, durable design.\n\nCELEBRATION (Fall 2012): The Celebration Collection is composed entirely of plastic trophy topper figurines affixed together at carious points using small screws. The collection is meant to signify the importance of unity and bond between people.\n\nReferences\n\nGood Morning America Lady Gaga 'Applause' Debut on 'GMA': 'Total Dream Come True'\" Yahoo. | Yahoo!

She entered the house on Day 0 with the rest of the original housemates of the series. She was taken to the Revenge Room with Camilla on Day 9 as part of a fake Double Eviction. From the Revenge Room, they enacted revenge on the housemates who had nominated them by being allowed to control elements of the House such as when the hot water was turned off. They were allowed to return to the rest of the House on Day 11. After returning from the Revenge Room, Anna seemed to form a tighter bond with the men in the House. She was the 4th evicted from the house on Day 29 with 25% of the merged vote. Her catchphrase whilst in the house was \"Game on, moles\" She later admitted on Big Brother UpLate that she forgot she had said the line. Anna appeared on the cover of the August 2006 issue of Ralph.\n\nAshley\n\nMichael Cox, was the third Michael of three Michaels to enter the house. Although he used a pseudo name because Michael McCoy, who enter the house first took the name Michael. Known to the public as Ashley before his removal from the House (born 4 March 1986) is a bricklayer from Rockingham, Western Australia, of part Italian descent. He entered the House on Day 0 with the rest of the original housemates of the series. Many housemates perceived Ashley like a little brother. He was often seen in the House talking about cars, a passion of his. Ashley revealed on Day 33 that he had never met his brother and sister and finding them was part of the reason why he participated in Big Brother. Ashley was saved from being up for eviction in the first week by Gaelan, who used his Three Point Twist received from winning Friday Night Live; he was later saved from the eviction line-up by David exercising his Three Point Twist. On Day 70 (1 July 2006) at approximately 4:30\u00a0a.m., it is alleged Ashley slapped his penis on Camilla's face while John held her down. Later that day, Ashley and John were removed from the House under escort due to their breach of the rules. Queensland Police were informed of the incident but do not plan to pursue the matter. During his time in the House, Ashley had been up for eviction only once.\nWhile all former 2006 Big Brother housemates and intruders were all reunited for the 2006 Finale]], disqualified housemates, Ashley and John were not invited to attend and participate.\n\nCamilla\nCamilla Severi (alias \"Camilla Halliwell\", now \"Camilla Harper\"), born 28 October 1983, in South Africa, is a student and nightclub host from Rowville, Melbourne and was the runner-up of Big Brother 2006. She entered the House on Day 0 with the rest of the original housemates of the series. She was evicted from the house on Day 9 along with Anna when they received the most nominations in a special 'Most Annoying' vote by hous a hidden room\u2014accessible via the eviction exit passageway\u2014called the Revenge Room. Upon their arrival they were shown the nominations for 'most annoying' housemate. Camilla reacted particularly badly to Tilli's nomination in which Tilli described Camilla as \"forced and fake\". Big Brother gave the two housemates control on the house and allowed them to enact revenge on their housemates. After being slated for eviction, which resulted in a nickname of 'the Veteran' from her fellow housemates, she was up for eviction in Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 14. This was the most nominations with nine towards one housemate beating Bree Amer's eight nominations. She was up for eviction every week she was eligible except for Week 8 and Week 11. (she was immune from nomination in Week 2 after her false eviction in Week 1, she was initially nominated in Week 13, but was removed from the eviction line-up after Jamie took 3 points off her.) On Day 70, Camilla was involved in an incident where she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Ashley and John who were removed from the house as a result of their actions. During The Prize Fight, Big Brother told Camilla before a game that she was the worst performer in the history of Friday Night Live, being eliminated in the 1st round 8 times. However, she did come runner-up on the World Cup Night along with eventual winner David. In October 2006, Camilla relocated to Brisbane where she became part of the breakfast team with B105. Camilla has given birth to baby boy Charlie with the B105 sound technician, Glen Krohn. Camilla received the most fines whilst isolated in the Big Brother house; totalling $105,000 Camilla left radio station B105 (now Hit 105) in 2011, to take up an opportunity with on Breakfast with Nova in Brisbane. This did not go well, and she left that station quickly. She remained with that network, presenting on a digital only channel, \"Koffee\". Ultimately, she moved to Bali, and has settled down there. She gave a revealing recorded interview to Meshel Laurie, in 2015.\n\nChris\nChris Everden (born 22 December 1983) is a 22-year-old musician from Sydney, New South Wales. He entered the House on Day 80 (11 July) as one of two replacement housemates who entered the House after the removal of John and Ashley. He is into punk/rock music, and bands like Taking Back Sunday, My Chemical Romance, and The Used. Chris was evicted in a Surprise Eviction on a Wednesday, on Day 95 (26 July), with 69% of the merged vote.\n\nClaire Madden\nClaire Madden (born 17 June 1983) is a big cat zookeeper from the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. She entered the House on Day 0 with the rest of the original housemates of the series. She entertained the House with various original songs, as housemates are forbidden to sing any commercial music. Claire is a vegetarian and is concerned about conservation of the environment. When asked during Housemates on Trial if she would eat meat to win the prize money, she said she wouldn't, and the Layered Voice Analysis said she was telling the truth. This was in response to her saying on Launch that she would eat meat for a million dollars, the amount of money the winner would have won had the housemates not incurred any fines. Claire was nominated for eviction in Week 2. She was also put up for potential nomination in the Under the Radar vote but did not receive enough audience votes to be nominated for eviction. Claire won Friday Night Live in Week 9, and took Rob to the Rewards Room because he was the only housemate, other than the recently arrived Intruders, who had never been in there. She used her Three Point Twist on David during the following Monday's Nominations, however this failed to remove him from the line-up. The reduction in his points put him into a third place tie with Camilla, so David remained up for eviction while Camilla was added to the eviction line-up. Claire was born in Geelong, but at a young age, relocated to the Gold Coast where she completed the majority of her primary and secondary education. Claire was evicted from the house on Day 92, with 49% of the merged vote. On leaving the house she met Jamie Brooksby's (fellow housemate, eventual winner of the series) brother, Jon. Claire and Jon have been dating ever since.\nClaire travelled to Borneo in June 2007 to produce her first wildlife documentary exploring the plight of the orangutan. This production was sponsored by Kumuka travel (a sponsor of Big Brother). Since leaving the big brother house Claire has been named an ambassador for numerous wildlife charities including WWF (World Wildlife Fund), AOP (Australian Orangutan Project) and Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors.\nShe has created her own website www.zoogirlclaire.com\n\nDanielle\nDanielle Foote (born 8 June 1987) was a host of Supre TV from Adelaide. Danielle was the third Intruder to enter the House on Day 24, the other two being Rob and Jade. She was the youngest housemate of Big Brother 2006. Danielle became romantically involved with Dino after Katie's 20th birthday party. However, she had told other housemates such as John and Michael that she had similar feelings for John. The situation was openly described as being a love triangle by several housemates, but this situation came to a halt with Dino's eviction on Day 43, after which John refused to pursue Danielle.\n\nDani's 19th birthday was on Day 47. During her party, she was speaking without her microphone which was discarded when she changed clothes. Because of this, she spent the remainder of her birthday in the Punishment Room cleaning dirty dentures, themed by the Scream Week task and her Scream Week-themed birthday party.\n\nDanielle was nominated for eviction with Camilla and Rob and was the 8th person evicted from the House on Day 50, receiving 44% of the merged vote. The night after her eviction she was on the Nominations show, Dino was also on the show as a special guest. The two made up and made it clear that \"everything was alright\" between them.\n\nIn August 2006, Danielle managed to have a #41 hit single in Australia with a cover version of the 1988 Underworld song \"Underneath The Radar\". The song was also performed on the final eviction show for Big Brother Series 2006.\n\nDarren\nDarren Bowley (born 14 August 1986) is a 20-year-old student from Brisbane, Queensland. He was an Intruder housemate, taking the place of intended Intruder Gina who failed to report to lockdown at the allocated time, entering the house on Day 60 (21 June). On entering the House, Darren initially disliked Perry, John, and Jamie, but developed a strong bond with David. Darren was nominated for eviction in Week 11, but David removed him from the line-up using the Three Point Twist. Darren won the third Friday Night Live he participated in, themed \"Yankee Doodle Night\", and asked David if he wished to go to the rewards room with him, but David replied \"Just because you're a guy, doesn't mean I want to bonk you\"; and Darren decided to take Krystal to the Rewards Room. Darren was nominated for eviction on Week 12 along with David and Camilla. He used the Three Point Twist to deduct three points from himself. This reduction in his nomination points tally brought him into the third-place tied position with Krystal, so he remained up for eviction and Krystal was added to the eviction line-up. Darren was the last of the second set of Intruders to leave the house on Day 85, with 73% of the merged vote, the highest merged eviction percentage of the series.\n\nDavid\nDavid Graham (born 28 August 1979) is a farmer and former model from Goondiwindi, Queensland. David entered the house on Day 0 with the rest of the original housemates of the series. David revealed to the housemates he was gay on Day 4. David bonded immediately with Camilla (although she was upset when he and Tilli kissed as a joke soon after he revealed he was gay), and later Intruder Rob joined their group. David was happy to have another gay man in the house, and they remained close until Rob's eviction. He bonded with Michael, and was visibly upset after learning Michael had lied to the housemates repeatedly as the Insider. Michael and David were still close enough that the blurred lines of their friendship led David to ask Michael if he was gay. Soon after, Michael led other housemates to believe David had stolen their toothbrushes. This led to some heated arguments until after Michael's eviction, when Big Brother told them Michael was the culprit. David and Camilla also grew somewhat apart as time went on. Due to his feeling that Camilla was playing nice with other housemates to avoid being nominated by them, David nominated her in Week 10, a decision that caused him some anguish. David eventually became very good friends with Claire, despite of some ideological differences (she was a vegetarian, he was a sheep farmer). David also had an initially close friendship with Intruder Darren. David won Friday Night Live in Week 7, won a trip to Vietnam and took Camilla to the rewards room; he took the 3 points off Ashley, even though he himself was up for nomination. He said only a \"jerk\" would take points from himself. David won again in Week 10, took Perry to the rewards room (she was runner-up in the game), and won a trip to Thailand. David was up for eviction in Weeks 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13. He was originally nominated in Week 5, but Gaelan removed three points from him, clearing him from the eviction line-up. In Week 11 David again used his Three Point Twist on someone else (Darren) in spite of being up for nomination himself. This act successfully removed Darren from the eviction line-up.\n\nDavid was evicted on Day 99 along with Max as part of a Double Eviction the day before the Finale. David had more 'save' votes than eventual series winner Jamie, but was still evicted, as Jamie had less 'evict' votes than David, with the final tally coming out in Jamie's favour. As David was entering the auditorium, a male audience member ran towards David, but was tackled to the ground by Dreamworld security officers. It was later revealed that the man was a friend of David's, and he was wanting to inform him that the Melbourne Demons had clinched an AFL Finals spot. During the eviction David was reunited with his boyfriend Sherif, whom he met four weeks before entering the house. The reunion was an emotional one, with David clearly overwhelmed by the audience\u2019s positive response and the fact that his boyfriend of only four weeks had waited for him after three months of separation.\n\nSome of David's photos had been stolen from his home, and somebody tried to sell one on eBay. The auction was closed early by eBay, and police looked into the matter.\n\nDavid was the winner of Australia's Brainiest BB06 Housemate.\n\nHe was a competitor in the current series of Dancing with the Stars, but was voted out on 10 April 2007. He currently runs a business trading as Farmer Dave Dog Centre, as well as making occasional appearances on television programs such as the Australian edition of Ready Steady Cook.\nAlso featured on the ABC's Australian Story\n\nDino\nDino Delic (born 9 April 1984) is a business marketing student from Melbourne, Victoria. Dino moved to Australia as a refugee with his family in 1992 from Bosnia via Germany after escaping war there. He was the seventh housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 43 along with Jade, attracting 5% of the merged vote. During his stay in the house, Dino attracted much attention for what many viewers perceived as arrogant comments made about fellow housemates. After his eviction, Dino denied these allegations. After being evicted he was shown footage depicting the growing attraction between Danielle and John that developed simultaneous to his flirtatious relationship with her. Dino stated that he regretted never clarifying with Danielle that he did not see their relationship as serious, claiming that he felt John and Danielle made a good couple and that he did not wish to stand in their way. His closest friends in the house were John, Michael, and Jamie. Jamie was clearly distraught by Dino's departure from the house. His most memorable moment was spending half a day within 5 metres of Camilla as a dare, which created much distress and confusion for some housemates and amusement and laughter for the others. Dino was comically titled the \"arrogant wanker\" on Rove Live, a title which he seemed proud to carry. Since leaving the house, his relationship with Dani has ended.\n\nElise Chen\nElise Chen (born 26 November 1984) is a student and financial analyst from Sydney, New South Wales. She moved to Australia when she was 5 years old and did not speak a word of English. She entered the house on Day 0 with all of the original housemates. During the Friday Night Live games, she was mocked on numerous occasions by co-host Ryan Fitzgerald and host Mike Goldman, though their comments may be interpreted as jokes. Throughout her stay she was seen as one of the quieter housemates and this quietness was regarded as a major contributor to her nomination and subsequent eviction in the second week. On her Eviction Night, she did not attract the most evict votes out of the five housemates up for eviction, but she received less save votes than the other housemates. She attended Fort Street High School in Petersham, New South Wales and later attended the University of New South Wales. She was employed to commence her traineeship position as an analyst at prestigious investment bank Goldman Sachs just before she entered the house.\n\nGaelan\nGaelan Walker (born 25 December 1979) is a carpenter and model from Melbourne, Victoria. He entered the House on Day 0 along with the original housemates. He formed a relationship with Krystal. Gaelan was only ever up for eviction once, in Week 10. Before the week of his eviction, Gaelan had only ever received 1 nomination point. Gaelan's nomination came from only two housemates, Camilla and David, with Camilla suggesting Gaelan was going Under the Radar and purposely avoiding conflict to win the game. While Gaelan was often perceived to be most popular with the public by his fellow housemates, he was in fact the least popular original housemate. While in the house, Gaelan frequently acted as a comedian, which is what led his housemates to believe that he was popular with the viewers. However, most of Gaelen's \"comedy\" and language was too racy for the show's 7pm time slot, leading to him being perceived by viewers as something of a non-entity who rarely appeared on the daily show (as edited by Gaelan). He was evicted on Day 71 with 48% of the merged public vote. He also appeared on an episode of The Wedge as Lucy's new boyfriend. Gaelan is a supporter of the Melbourne Victory football club.\n\nJade\nJade Stack (born 30 November 1986) is a student from the suburb of Penrith, New South Wales. She entered the house on Day 24 with the two other Intruders Rob and Danielle. She entered the house second after Rob and was given an incredibly enthusiastic reception by the women in the house. However, some time after Danielle entered the house Jade began to feel isolated from the rest of the house. She was given the task as the new Insider on Day 24 after the previous Insider, Michael, had his role revealed by Big Brother to the housemates. Jade was the 6th housemate evicted from the house on Day 42 with 8% of the merged vote. Dino was evicted the same night, it being a Double Eviction.\n\nJamie\nJamie Brooksby (born 28 June 1983) is a personal trainer from Claremont, Perth, Western Australia and was the winner of Big Brother 2006. He entered the house on Day 0 with the other 14 original housemates. He formed a romantic relationship with fellow housemate Katie. Jamie was up for eviction for the first time in Week 8, but Katie was evicted. He was then up for eviction the following week and again survived. Jamie was banned from nominating other housemates in Week 10 as a punishment for repeated rule-breaking including what Big Brother considered as Jamie discussing nominations (in particular, who nominated whom). The rules of the show ban any discussion about nominations to prevent housemate alliances from forming.\n\nJamie largely avoided conflict with fellow housemates. He admitted to not washing his underpants for over three months. He was compared to Ben Stiller's character Derek Zoolander from the movie Zoolander, not only because of his constant need to check his hair, but also because of his voice and his frequent usage of the word 'like.' A Big Brother show once showed a clip in which the amount of 'like's Jamie used in a thirty-second discussion were tallied: eight. Although picked by Centrebet to be the runner-up, Jamie won Big Brother 2006 with 53% of the merged vote. He received $426,000 as the winner of the series. He joked that he would spend the money on a solid gold house and a rocket car, as Chester Lampwick did in The Simpsons episode The Day the Violence Died. On the night he was announced as winner, Jamie was reunited with Katie, and the pair proclaimed their love for one another.\n\nKatie had heard little from Jamie since the finale, until 22 August when Jamie spent 24 hours in the window of Myer Melbourne as part of a Bonds underwear promotion, and Katie spent some of the time with him. He returned to Perth on 30 August 2006, for five days.\n\nJohn\nMichael Bric, known as John before his removal from the House, (born 2 May 1985) is a Media and Communications student from Melbourne. He is of Austrian and Brazilian descent. Along with Krystal, he was voted as going \"Under the Radar\" by the public on Day 38, and was subsequently put up for eviction later that week, but survived the vote. He has slight facial twitches and tics, and early in the series told the housemates that he had a mild case of Tourette syndrome; although he later claimed he does not believe that he has it. John won \"Pommy Night\", an English-themed Friday Night Live on Day 55, and took Claire to the Rewards Room. On Day 70 (1 July 2006) John, and Ashley, were removed from the House for breach of rules, after alleged sexual misconduct against Camilla. Queensland Police were notified of the incident but decided to not pursue the case. While being held in isolation immediately after his removal, John expressed a desire to leave the country to visit relatives in Austria in order to escape the negative publicity. While all former 2006 Big Brother housemates and intruders were all reunited for the 2006 [[Big Brother Australia#Finale|Finale, disqualified housemates, Ashley and John were not invited to attend and participate.\n\nKaren\nKaren Forscutt (born 19 August 1969) is a postal worker from Batemans Bay, New South Wales. She entered the house on Day 0 with her daughter Krystal and was immediately given the task along with daughter Krystal to keep their relationship a secret. They successfully passed the task and so were immune from nominations the following week. In Week 3, Karen stated that she was sick of the game and was disappointed when Big Brother told the housemates that they were not guaranteed prizes. Her negative reaction to this provoked some of her housemates to nominate her for eviction that week. She was the clear favourite to leave that week and did so becoming the 3rd evicted from the house on Day 21 with 36% of the merged vote. She had been described as a hippy mother in compilation footage shown to viewers of the series.\n\nKatie\nKatie Hastings (born 23 May 1986) is a promotional model from Perth, Western Australia, of part Norwegian descent. Katie entered the house on Day 0 and formed a romantic relationship with fellow housemate Jamie. She won Friday Night Live on Day 41, and chose to take Jamie to the Rewards Room with her. In Week 7, Camilla, Rob, and Danielle were up for eviction. Katie used her Three Point Twist on Camilla, but the eviction line-up did not change. She was up for eviction in Week 8 with David and Jamie, and despite being one of the more popular housemates with the public and an early contender for winner, she stated that she wanted to be the contestant to leave so she then became the 9th evictee, leaving the house on Day 57 . Katie was reunited with Jamie at the Finale where they declared their love for one another. Katie was considered one of the top ten most popular contestants of all time with her quick banner and care free attitude. \n\nKatie and Jamie broke up shortly after the show. Rumours circulated that Jamie was unfaithful to Katie but Katie would not confirm or deny the rumours. \n\nKatie appeared on the 2007 Kath & Kim episode \"Work\", as Kel Knight's (Glenn Robbins) butcher apprentice. Katie also appeared on a number of other TV shows including Rove Live and The Brainiest House Mate. Katie modelled for Pirate bikinis and men magazines after the show.\n\nKatie left the entertainment industry and went back to university where she was granted an invite into the Golden Key Society as she made the top 10% of students. She now is an International Manager for a Global Company and is rumoured to be engaged to the companies Lawyer who works in the same field.\n\nKrystal\nKrystal Forscutt (born 12 July 1986) is a promotional model from Batemans Bay, New South Wales. She entered the house at the beginning of the series with her mother Karen, who have both had matching breast implants, and they were given the task of keeping their relationship a secret for a week. Day ? They successfully passed the task and were immune from nominations the following week. Krystal was subsequently up for eviction in Weeks 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, and 13. In Week 6, Danielle used her Three Point Twist on Krystal, removing her from the eviction line-up, however in that week the public voted her as Under the Radar, and was put up for eviction. While in the house Krystal entered a relationship with Gaelan. Krystal was injured during Day 62's Friday Night Games. She had to leave the Friday Night Live arena and was treated by a doctor in the spare room, receiving nine stitches under her chin. Due to her injuries she was told it was best to sit out for the next Friday Night Live, instead being given Chinese food while she sat out, watching the games from inside the arena. Krystal's birthday was on 12 July 2006 (Day 81), and she had a Pirate-themed party, revelating around the task they had at the time. She was also given a chocolate fountain. Krystal was evicted in a double eviction (along with Claire) on Day 92, with 34% of the merged vote.\n\nKrystal appeared on the cover of the June Issue of Ralph magazine as well as appearing on the cover of The Shed three times. She has secured a 12-month contract with lad's mag Zoo Weekly where she will write a regular column, feature in TV campaigns and appear on the cover of a late August 2006 issue.\n\nLauren\nLauren Clayton (born 15 October 1983) is a 22-year-old makeup artist from New South Wales. She entered the House as an Intruder on Day 60 (21 June), and was evicted on Day 64 in a Housemate-Intruder vote. She revealed in her introduction package that she is bisexual, this is something her mother in the audience did not know prior to watching it. Lauren broke two records while being in the house: she spent the shortest ever time in the Big Brother House (4 days), and she was the only Big Brother Australia housemate not to receive any fines since the concept came into action in 2005.\n\nMax\nJames Panebianco, known on Big Brother as Max, is a 20 year old caf\u00e9 operator from Sydney, New South Wales. He resides in Sydney's western suburbs and his parents are of Italian heritage. He entered the house on Day 80 (11 July) as a replacement housemate, and took with him a gift for Perry, but he was put in lockdown before she was evicted. The gift was a T-shirt that read \"Let's not spoil the moment by talking\". Camilla could later be seen wearing the T-shirt. Max was evicted on Day 99 in the Final Sunday Eviction, with 10% of the merged vote.\n\nMax's father owns a caf\u00e9 at the University of Sydney, and several members of the family run the business.\n\nMichael McCoy\nMichael McCoy (born 16 June 1980) is a political science student from Sydney, New South Wales. He is of Anglo-Celtic and Filipino descent. Michael was the first housemate to enter the Big Brother House this year.\n\nOn Day 2, he was given the task of the Insider by Big Brother, having been chosen by the viewing public. If he succeeded in his tasks, he would be immune from being nominated, but if he failed he would automatically be put up for eviction.\n\nHe failed his first mission within minutes of being assigned the task, which was to secretly spill water on a bed that was occupied by two housemates. Michael opted to spill water on Gaelan's bed, which at the time was only used by Gaelan himself. Because of that, and because he also didn't empty the whole bottle, he was awarded his first strike. Soon after, he was given other missions, one of which was to be nominated by at least eight of his fellow housemates in the next round of nominations. To complete this mission he fabricated a story about a custody issue concerning his young son Reuben, claiming he wanted to leave the house to concentrate on this issue. After Big Brother revealed to the other housemates that Michael was the Insider, and that the Reuben story was pure fiction, Michael faced a strong backlash from several housemates angry at being duped in this way, especially from Anna, who had little contact with her father, and David, who was angry at the depth and complexity of the lies Michael had told. It was revealed on Michael's eviction night that Reuben is the name of one of Michael's real life friends.\n\nDespite no longer being the Insider, Michael continued to cause conflict in Week 5, hiding cutlery as well as hiding the housemates' toothbrushes from them, never revealing their locations even after he had been evicted, attempting to create doubts as to whether or not there is another insider inside the house besides Michael. He was the 5th housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 36, with 20% of the merged vote.\n\nThe day after he was evicted, Michael appeared on the Nominations show and had a heated discussion with Gretel Killeen about the producers' editing regarding a scene where Michael and housemate David appeared to be kissing. The outfall resulted in media attention and the interview with Gretel was later labelled \"The Gretel Incident\" by some fans due to Gretel's hostile interviewing tactics during the scene. The show initially refused to broadcast the footage of the alleged kiss, but relented after pressure from Michael and Big Brother fans. The footage revealed that Michael and housemate David did not kiss, despite Gretel insisting during the interview that they did kiss.\n\nThe day after this incident Michael appeared on Rove Live. When asked about \"The Gretel Incident\", Michael suggested that Friday Night Live and Big Brother UpLate host Mike Goldman, or Friday Night Live co-host and former housemate Ryan Fitzgerald, would be better hosts of Big Brother than Gretel Killeen.\n\nNot long after being evicted, Michael was involved in a brawl with music student Tristan Bauer, allegedly punching him in the head at the Eastern Hotel in Bondi Junction, Sydney. Mr. Bauer claimed that the attack was unprovoked, although Michael's agency, Harry M. Miller, has stated that he only reacted after 'homophobic' comments had been made in his direction. Michael was never formally charged with any offence.\n\nAs has become custom over the history of the show, Michael appeared along with all the other 2006 housemates on the Rove Live episode of the week of the final. Michael was asked if he had any regrets. His response was that he regretted that John and Ashley were not on the show and questioned Rove as to why he did not have them on the show.\n\nPerry\nPerry Apostolou (born 4 March 1967) is a 41-year-old estate agent from New South Wales. She is a single mother of one and is of Greek descent. Perry entered the House on Day 60 (21 June). As of that date she had become the oldest housemate on Big Brother Australia yet, as well as being the one hundredth housemate on the series. In Week 10 Perry was runner up in Friday Night Games. David won and took her to the rewards room. In Week 11 Perry was nominated for eviction, and then she was evicted on Day 78. Perry had attracted 64% of the merged vote. Three of the housemates who had nominated Perry (Camilla, Jamie and Krystal) later told Big Brother that they regretted nominating her.\n\nRob Rigley\nRob Rigley (born 18 July 1979) is a hairdresser from Wollongong, New South Wales. He is of Anglo-Celtic and Lebanese descent. He entered the house on Day 24 as an Intruder, along with Danielle and Jade, and the fact that he was gay was quickly the topic of conversation between Camilla and David, creating friendships between them that lasted the entirety of his stay in the house. He was fast to instill doubt within other housemates as to the honesty of Michael. Rob was perceived by some in the house, especially Michael as bitchy, but others as warm and amusing. He had an increasingly tense relationship with Michael and Jamie until they made peace in Week 9. He was up for eviction in Week 7 and Week 9, where he was evicted on Day 64, and was the last of the first set of Intruders to leave the house. On Rove the following week, Rove offered to cut Rob's mullet. Rob agreed as long as it was for charity. When he tried to cut it however, Rove was unable to get the scissors through his hair.\n\nTilli\nTilli Elspeth Clapham, (born 18 August 1986) is a Psychology student from Adelaide Hills, South Australia. She entered the House on Day 0 with all the original housemates and was straight away seen to be bitchy. Tilli kissed housemate David on Day 4 soon after he came out, which caused conflict with Camilla, who was still recovering from the realisation that David was not attracted to her because he was gay. When prompted in the Diary Room about who she found annoying, Tilli commented that Camilla was \"forced and fake\", which Camilla eventually saw replayed back to her when she was in the Revenge Room. Tilli was the first evictee, leaving the House on Day 14 with 20% of the merged vote along with Elise in a Double Eviction.\n\nGina\nGina, from New South Wales, was intended as the sixteenth original housemate, but withdrew from the show at the last minute (before the series began) due to a diagnosis of glandular fever. She was given a second opportunity to enter the House as one of the Intruders that entered the house on 21 June's Intruders - Incoming show, but she did not arrive for lockdown at the Gold Coast as arranged, so she was replaced by Darren, a stand-by housemate.\n\nFame\nA few housemates have sustained moderate celebrity status since the series ended. Claire will begin her own environmental show (filmed in Borneo), Krystal was a contestant on the 2007 season of It Takes Two, David was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars from February to April 2007. Additionally, Camilla hosted a breakfast radio show in Brisbane. Danielle recorded a single \"Underneath The Radar\" and had minor chart success in Australia.\n\nNotes\n\nCategory:Big Brother (Australian TV series) contestants\nCategory:Lists of reality show participants", "National Aviation Intelligence Integration Office\n\nThe National Aviation Intelligence Integration Office (NAI2O) is the lead organization for coordinating and integrating the United States Government's (USG) Intelligence Community (IC) perspective on civil aviation issues.

Such alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They are light in weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures. However, the high cost of both raw materials and processing limit their use to military applications, aircraft, spacecraft, bicycles, medical devices, jewelry, highly stressed components such as connecting rods on expensive sports cars and some premium sports equipment and consumer electronics.\n\nAlthough \"commercially pure\" titanium has acceptable mechanical properties and has been used for orthopedic and dental implants, for most applications titanium is alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and vanadium, typically 6% and 4% respectively, by weight. This mixture has a solid solubility which varies dramatically with temperature, allowing it to undergo precipitation strengthening. This heat treatment process is carried out after the alloy has been worked into its final shape but before it is put to use, allowing much easier fabrication of a high-strength product.\n\nCategories \nTitanium alloys are generally classified into four main categories:\n Alpha alloys which contain neutral alloying elements (such as tin) and/ or alpha stabilisers (such as aluminium or oxygen) only. These are not heat treatable. Examples include: Ti-5Al-2Sn-ELI, Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V.\n Near-alpha alloys contain small amount of ductile beta-phase. Besides alpha-phase stabilisers, near-alpha alloys are alloyed with 1\u20132% of beta phase stabilizers such as molybdenum, silicon or vanadium. Examples include: Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo, Ti-5Al-5Sn-2Zr-2Mo, IMI 685, Ti 1100.\n Alpha and beta alloys, which are metastable and generally include some combination of both alpha and beta stabilisers, and which can be heat treated. Examples include: Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-6Al-4V-ELI, Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn, Ti-6Al-7Nb.\n Beta and near beta alloys, which are metastable and which contain sufficient beta stabilisers (such as molybdenum, silicon and vanadium) to allow them to maintain the beta phase when quenched, and which can also be solution treated and aged to improve strength. Examples include: Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al, Ti\u201329Nb\u201313Ta\u20134.6Zr, Ti-13V-11Cr-3Al, Ti-8Mo-8V-2Fe-3Al, Beta C, Ti-15-3.\n\nBeta-titanium\nBeta titanium alloys exhibit the BCC allotropic form of titanium (called beta). Elements used in this alloy are one or more of the following other than titanium in varying amounts. These are molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, manganese, iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper.\n\nThe titanium alloys have excellent formability and can be easily welded.\n\nBeta titanium is nowadays largely utilized in the orthodontic field and was adopted for orthodontics use in the 1980s. This type of alloy replaced stainless steel for certain uses, as stainless steel had dominated orthodontics since the 1960s. It has strength/modulus of elasticity ratios almost twice those of 18-8 austenitic stainless steel, larger elastic deflections in springs, and reduced force per unit displacement 2.2 times below those of stainless steel appliances.\n\nTransition temperature \nThe crystal structure of titanium at ambient temperature and pressure is close-packed hexagonal \u03b1 phase with a c/a ratio of 1.587. At about 890\u00a0\u00b0C, the titanium undergoes an allotropic transformation to a body-centred cubic \u03b2 phase which remains stable to the melting temperature.\n\nSome alloying elements, called alpha stabilizers, raise the alpha-to-beta transition temperature, while others (beta stabilizers) lower the transition temperature. Aluminium, gallium, germanium, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are alpha stabilizers. Molybdenum, vanadium, tantalum, niobium, manganese, iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper and silicon are beta stabilizers.\n\nProperties \nGenerally, beta-phase titanium is the more ductile phase and alpha-phase is stronger yet less ductile, due to the larger number of slip planes in the bcc structure of the beta-phase in comparison to the hcp alpha-phase. Alpha-beta-phase titanium has a mechanical property which is in between both.\n\nTitanium dioxide dissolves in the metal at high temperatures, and its formation is very energetic. These two factors mean that all titanium except the most carefully purified has a significant amount of dissolved oxygen, and so may be considered a Ti\u2013O alloy. Oxide precipitates offer some strength (as discussed above), but are not very responsive to heat treatment and can substantially decrease the alloy's toughness.\n\nMany alloys also contain titanium as a minor additive, but since alloys are usually categorized according to which element forms the majority of the material, these are not usually considered to be \"titanium alloys\" as such. See the sub-article on titanium applications. Commercial (99.2% purity) grades of titanium have an ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa, equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. The titanium used for surface alloying of AISI304 stainless steel was CP-Ti, grade2, 300\u00b5m thick sheet.\n\nTitanium alone is a strong, light metal. It is stronger than common, low-carbon steels, but 45% lighter. It is also twice as strong as weak aluminium alloys but only 60% heavier. Titanium has outstanding corrosion resistance to seawater, and thus is used in propeller shafts, rigging and other parts of boats that are exposed to seawater. Titanium and its alloys are used in airplanes, missiles, and rockets where strength, low weight, and resistance to high temperatures are important. Further, since titanium does not react within the human body, it and its alloys are used in artificial joints, screws, and plates for fractures, and for other biological implants. See Titanium#Orthopedic implants.\n\nTitanium grades \nThe ASTM International standard on titanium and titanium alloy seamless pipe references the following alloys, requiring the following treatment:\n\"Alloys may be supplied in the following conditions: Grades 5, 23, 24, 25, 29, 35, or 36 annealed or aged; Grades 9, 18, 28, or 38 cold-worked and stress-relieved or annealed; Grades 9, 18, 23, 28, or 29 transformed-beta condition; and Grades 19, 20, or 21 solution-treated or solution-treated and aged.\"\n\"Note 1\u2014H grade material is identical to the corresponding numeric grade (that is, Grade 2H = Grade 2) except for the higher guaranteed minimum UTS, and may always be certified as meeting the requirements of its corresponding numeric grade. Grades 2H, 7H, 16H, and 26H are intended primarily for pressure vessel use.\"\n\"The H grades were added in response to a user association request based on its study of over 5200 commercial Grade 2, 7, 16, and 26 test reports, where over 99% met the 58 ksi minimum UTS.\"\n Grade 1 is the most ductile and softest titanium alloy.  It is a good solution for cold forming and corrosive environments. ASTM/ASME SB-265 provides the standards for commercially pure titanium sheet and plate.\n Grade 2 Unalloyed titanium, standard oxygen.\n Grade 2H Unalloyed titanium (Grade 2 with 58 ksi minimum UTS).\n Grade 3 Unalloyed titanium, medium oxygen.\n\nGrades 1-4 are unalloyed and considered commercially pure or \"CP\". Generally the tensile and yield strength goes up with grade number for these \"pure\" grades. The difference in their physical properties is primarily due to the quantity of interstitial elements. They are used for corrosion resistance applications where cost, ease of fabrication, and welding are important.\n Grade 5 also known as Ti6Al4V, Ti-6Al-4V or Ti 6-4\n not to be confused with Ti-6Al-4V-ELI (Grade 23), is the most commonly used alloy. It has a chemical composition of 6% aluminum, 4% vanadium, 0.25% (maximum) iron, 0.2% (maximum) oxygen, and the remainder titanium. It is significantly stronger than commercially pure titanium (grades 1-4) while having the same stiffness and thermal properties (excluding thermal conductivity, which is about 60% lower in Grade 5 Ti than in CP Ti). Among its many advantages, it is heat treatable. This grade is an excellent combination of strength, corrosion resistance, weld and fabricability.\n\n\"This alpha-beta alloy is the workhorse alloy of the titanium industry. The alloy is fully heat treatable in section sizes up to 15\u00a0mm and is used up to approximately 400\u00a0\u00b0C (750\u00a0\u00b0F). Since it is the most commonly used alloy \u2013 over 70% of all alloy grades melted are a sub-grade of Ti6Al4V, its uses span many aerospace airframe and engine component uses and also major non-aerospace applications in the marine, offshore and power generation industries in particular.\"\n\"Applications: Blades, discs, rings, airframes, fasteners, components. Vessels, cases, hubs, forgings. Biomedical implants.\"\n\nGenerally, Ti-6Al-4V is used in applications up to 400 degrees Celsius. It has a density of roughly 4420\u00a0kg/m3, Young's modulus of 120 GPa, and tensile strength of 1000 MPa. By comparison, annealed type 316 stainless steel has a density of 8000\u00a0kg/m3, modulus of 193 GPa, and tensile strength of 570 MPa. Tempered 6061 aluminium alloy has a density of 2700\u00a0kg/m3, modulus of 69 GPa, and tensile strength of 310 MPa, respectively.\n\nTi-6Al-4V standard specifications include:\n AMS: 4911, 4928, 4965, 4967, 6930, 6931, T-9046, T9047\n ASTM: B265, B348, F1472\n MIL: T9046 T9047\n DMS: 1592, 1570\n Grade 6 contains 5% aluminium and 2.5% tin. It is also known as Ti-5Al-2.5Sn. This alloy is used in airframes and jet engines due to its good weldability, stability and strength at elevated temperatures.\n Grade 7 contains 0.12 to 0.25% palladium. This grade is similar to Grade 2. The small quantity of palladium added gives it enhanced crevice corrosion resistance at low temperatures and high pH.\n Grade 7H is identical to Grade 7 with enhanced corrosion resistance.\n Grade 9 contains 3.0% aluminium and 2.5% vanadium. This grade is a compromise between the ease of welding and manufacturing of the \"pure\" grades and the high strength of Grade 5. It is commonly used in aircraft tubing for hydraulics and in athletic equipment.\n Grade 11 contains 0.12 to 0.25% palladium. This grade has enhanced corrosion resistance.\n Grade 12 contains 0.3% molybdenum and 0.8% nickel.\n Grades 13, 14, and 15 all contain 0.5% nickel and 0.05% ruthenium.\n Grade 16 contains 0.04 to 0.08% palladium. This grade has enhanced corrosion resistance.\n Grade 16H contains 0.04 to 0.08% palladium.\n Grade 17 contains 0.04 to 0.08% palladium. This grade has enhanced corrosion resistance.\n Grade 18 contains 3% aluminium, 2.5% vanadium and 0.04 to 0.08% palladium. This grade is identical to Grade 9 in terms of mechanical characteristics. The added palladium gives it increased corrosion resistance.\n Grade 19contains 3% aluminium, 8% vanadium, 6% chromium, 4% zirconium, and 4% molybdenum.\n Grade 20 contains 3% aluminium, 8% vanadium, 6% chromium, 4% zirconium, 4% molybdenum and 0.04% to 0.08% palladium.\n Grade 21 contains 15% molybdenum, 3% aluminium, 2.7% niobium, and 0.25% silicon.\n Grade 23 also known as Ti-6Al-4V-ELI or TAV-ELI contains 6% aluminium, 4% vanadium, 0.13% (maximum) Oxygen. ELI stands for Extra Low Interstitial. Reduced interstitial elements oxygen and iron improve ductility and fracture toughness with some reduction in strength. TAV-ELI is the most commonly used medical implant-grade titanium alloy.\nTi-6Al-4V-ELI standard specifications include:\n AMS: 4907, 4930, 6932, T9046, T9047\n ASTM: B265, B348, F136\n MIL: T9046 T9047\n Grade 24 contains 6% aluminium, 4% vanadium and 0.04% to 0.08% palladium.\n Grade 25 contains 6% aluminium, 4% vanadium and 0.3% to 0.8% nickel and 0.04% to 0.08% palladium.\n Grades 26, 26H, and 27 all contain 0.08 to 0.14% ruthenium.\n Grade 28 contains 3% aluminium, 2.5% vanadium and 0.08 to 0.14% ruthenium.\n Grade 29 contains 6% aluminium, 4% vanadium and 0.08 to 0.14% ruthenium.\n Grades 30 and 31 contain 0.3% cobalt and 0.05% palladium.\n Grade 32 contains 5% aluminium, 1% tin, 1% zirconium, 1% vanadium, and 0.8% molybdenum.\n Grades 33 and 34 contain 0.4% nickel, 0.015% palladium, 0.025% ruthenium, and 0.15% chromium .\n Grade 35 contains 4.5% aluminium, 2% molybdenum, 1.6% vanadium, 0.5% iron, and 0.3% silicon.\n Grade 36 contains 45% niobium.\n Grade 37 contains 1.5% aluminium.\n Grade 38 contains 4% aluminium, 2.5% vanadium, and 1.5% iron. This grade was developed in the 1990s for use as an armor plating. The iron reduces the amount of Vanadium needed as a beta stabilizer. Its mechanical properties are very similar to Grade 5, but has good cold workability similar to grade 9.\n\nHeat treatment\nTitanium alloys are heat treated for a number of reasons, the main ones being to increase strength by solution treatment and aging as well as to optimize special properties, such as fracture toughness, fatigue strength and high temperature creep strength.\n\nAlpha and near-alpha alloys cannot be dramatically changed by heat treatment. Stress relief and annealing are the processes that can be employed for this class of titanium alloys. The heat treatment cycles for beta alloys differ significantly from those for the alpha and alpha-beta alloys.  Beta alloys can not only be stress relieved or annealed, but also can be solution treated and aged. The alpha-beta alloys are two-phase alloys, comprising both alpha and beta phases at room temperature. Phase compositions, sizes, and distributions of phases in alpha-beta alloys can be manipulated within certain limits by heat treatment, thus permitting tailoring of properties.\n\nAlpha and near-alpha alloys The micro-structure of alpha alloys cannot be strongly manipulated by heat treatment since alpha alloys undergo no significant phase change. As a result, high strength can not be acquired for the alpha alloys by heat treatment. Yet, alpha and near-alpha titanium alloys can be stress relieved and annealed.\nAlpha-beta alloys By working as well as heat treatment of alpha-beta alloys below or above the alpha-beta transition temperature, large micro-structural changes can be achieved. This may give a substantial hardening of the material. Solution treatment plus aging is used to produce maximum strengths in alpha-beta alloys. Also, other heat treatments, including stress-relief heat treatments, are practiced for this group of titanium alloys as well.\nBeta alloys In commercial beta alloys, stress-relieving and aging treatments can be combined.\n\nTitanium alloys used biomedically \n\nTitanium alloys have been extensively used for the manufacturing of metal orthopedic joint replacements and bone plate surgeries. They are normally produced from wrought or cast bar stock by CNC, CAD-driven machining, or powder metallurgy production. Each of these techniques comes with inherent advantages and disadvantages. Wrought products come with an extensive material loss during machining into the final shape of the product and for cast samples the acquirement of a product in its final shape somewhat limits further processing and treatment (e.g. precipitation hardening), yet casting is more material effective. Traditional powder metallurgy methods are also more material efficient, yet acquiring fully dense products can be a common issue.\n\nWith the emergence of solid freeform fabrication (3D printing) the possibility to produce custom-designed biomedical implants (e.g. hip joints) has been realized. While it is not applied currently on a larger scale, freeform fabrication methods offers the ability to recycle waste powder (from the manufacturing process) and makes for selectivity tailoring desirable properties and thus the performance of the implant. Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are two methods applicable for freeform fabrication of Ti-alloys. Manufacturing parameters greatly influence the micro-structure of the product, where e.g. a fast cooling rate in combination with low degree of melting in SLM leads to the predominant formation of martensitic alpha-prime-phase, giving a very hard product.\n\n Ti-6Al-4V / Ti-6Al-4V-ELI This alloy has good biocompatibility, and is neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic.  Ti-6Al-4V suffers from poor shear strength and poor surface wear properties in certain loading conditions:Bio compatibility: Excellent, especially when direct contact with tissue or bone is required. Ti-6Al-4V's poor shear strength makes it undesirable for bone screws or plates. It also has poor surface wear properties and tends to seize when in sliding contact with itself and other metals. Surface treatments such as nitriding and oxidizing can improve the surface wear properties.\n Ti-6Al-7Nb This alloy was developed as a biomedical replacement for Ti-6Al-4V, because Ti-6Al-4V contains vanadium, an element that has demonstrated cytotoxic outcomes when isolated. Ti-6Al-7Nb contains 6% aluminium and 7% niobium.Ti6Al7Nb is a dedicated high strength titanium alloy with excellent biocompatibility for surgical implants. Used for replacement hip joints, it has been in clinical use since early 1986.\n\nReferences \nNotes\n\nSources\n\nExternal links \n\n http://www.tifab.com/subpages/tech_spec_grades.htm\n Datasheet for Beta Titanium\n Phase Stability and Stress-Induced Transformations in Beta Titanium Alloys \n\n \nAlloys\nCategory:Alloys\nCategory:Orthodontics", "Lawrence Clarke\n\nLawrence Clarke may refer to:\n\n Lawrence Clarke (politician) (1832\u20131890), Chief Factor of the District of Saskatchewan for the Hudson's Bay Company\n Lawrence Clarke (athlete) (born 1990), sprint hurdler\n\nSee also\n Lawrence Gordon Clark, English television director and producer\n Laurence Clark (disambiguation)\n Larry Clarke (1925\u20132015), Canadian businessman", "Sarah Slean EP\n\nSarah Slean is an EP by Sarah Slean, featuring three new tracks and four from her back catalogue.

They were built by British Rail workshops (from 1969 British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL)) between 1964 and 1975. They were of steel construction.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Mark 2 has a semi-integral construction, giving it more strength than a Mark 1 in the event of an accident.  A key driver of the changed construction method was to overcome the serious corrosion problem point in the Mark 1 at the base of the body, where it was attached to the underframe.  Other changes of design, such as the window units, were for the same reason, which had become a serious problem in Mark 1 vehicle maintenance costs.  Revised painting methods were also part of this, which coincided with the change of livery from maroon (dark green on the Southern) to the blue and grey that Mark 2 coaches wore for much of their lives (some of the earliest Mark 2 coaches had the old livery at first).\n\nThe Mark 2 coach was one of the mainstays of the InterCity network, but new rolling stock introduced in the post-privatisation era has resulted in most being withdrawn.\n\nSince their withdrawal from most main line duties, Mark 2 coaches have played an increasing role on private rail tours, charter trains, and on heritage railways. Since 1996, over 140 Mark 2 carriages have been exported to New Zealand, where they are still in mainline service (as of 2013).\n\nDevelopment\nThe prototype Mark 2, FK 13252, was built in 1963, and is now preserved by and located at the Mid-Norfolk Railway.\n\nThe final Mark 2 carriage was departmental 999550, in 1977.  it is still in service with Network Rail as a Track Recording Coach. The later versions (2D onwards) look somewhat similar to the later Mark 3 design. The Mark 3 is longer (75 feet as opposed to 64 feet 6\u00a0inches), has a large skirting between the bogies to conceal the ancillary equipment, and has a ridged roof as opposed to the smooth roof of the Mark 2. The development of the High Speed Train overlapped with that of the final production run, and the Mark 2F \"previewed\" many features incorporated into the Mark 3, such as new seating, plastic interior panelling, and floor-sensor-operated automatic gangway doors.\n\nUnlike Mark 1 coaches, built by a wide range of manufacturers, both BR workshops and private builders, all production Mark 2 (and Mark 3) coaches were built on a single assembly line at the BR carriage works at Derby.\n\nManchester Pullman\nMark 2 carriages were used on the Manchester Pullman service from 1966 until withdrawal in 1985. These luxuriously-appointed first class carriages had several unusual features, such as inward opening doors and some interior walnut panelling. Only 29 carriages were built. The livery was pearl grey with blue window surrounds, a reversal of the standard British Rail blue and grey livery of the late 1960s and 1970s. A Liverpool Pullman service was also operated, using the same type of carriages, until 1974.\n\nCurrent uses\nAs of May 2019, Mark 2 coaches are still in use on some services on the UK rail network.\n\nAbellio ScotRail operate two sets of six Riviera Trains Mark 2s hauled by a Class 68 on peak hour services on the Fife Circle Line.\nNetwork Rail operate Mark 2s as brake force carriages on its test trains.\nRiviera Trains and West Coast Railways both operate Mark 2s on charters; many of the former's are still painted in Anglia Railways and Virgin Trains liveries.\nTransport for Wales operates Mark 2s on some of their Valley Lines services.\n\nMultiple units based on the Mark 2\nUnlike the Mark 1, few multiple unit classes were based on the Mark 2 bodyshell. Most were electric multiple units with British Railways, and which operated under AC using overhead wires. The first of these were Class AM10 in 1966 operating commuter services from London Euston and in the West Midlands. The introduction of TOPS saw these units reclassified Class 310. The other type was Class 312, a derivative of, and almost identical to, the Class 310, introduced in 1975, primarily used on commuter services from London King's Cross and London Liverpool Street, the last slam-door multiple units built for British Railways. Northern Ireland Railways used the Mark 2 bodyshell as the basis for the 80 Class DEMU, which entered service in 1974. Thirteen 5 car electric multiple units were built in 1976 for Taiwan (and withdrawn in 2009): the Taiwan Railway EMU100 series.\n\nSales to other rail operators\nNorthern Ireland Railways and Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann purchased various types from new, and a number of ex-BR vehicles have been sold for further use outside Great Britain and abroad. Electric Multiple Units based on the Mark 2 design were also exported to Taiwan.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nIn 1970 Northern Ireland Railways purchased new Mark 2Bs for the Enterprise train service between Belfast and Dublin. These were initially painted in an attractive maroon and blue livery and worked by maroon BREL-built Hunslet Bo-Bos of the NIR 101 Class. A pale grey livery with a blue stripe below the windows was introduced in the 1980s. This rake included No 547, the only Mark 2B dining car. This carriage was restored in 2008 by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI). The Mark 2B carriages were replaced on the Enterprise service by new carriages built in France by De Dietrich Ferroviaire in 1996.\n\nNIR purchased eight British Rail Class 488 electric multiple unit coaches in 2001 that been converted from Mark 2F coaches for the Gatwick Express service from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport. They were renumbered 8941-8948, The worked with NIR Generator Van 8911. They were withdrawn on 19 January 2005, having been replaced by new C3K units. They were reintroduced in September 2006 to provide extra capacity on the Portadown to Belfast (Central) service, making one trip every morning, hauled by a Class 111 locomotive. An ex-Anglia MkIIf DBSO, No. 9712 (renumbered by NIR as 8918), was bought that year to work with the Gatwick stock, but overhaul and regauging took so long that by the time it arrived in Northern Ireland in 2009, the Gatwicks had been withdrawn. Their final passenger run was on 18 June 2009.\n\nThe RPSI also acquired some Mark 2s for use in its steam hauled train in Northern Ireland in the early 2000s (decade). These are normally based at the RPSI's Whitehead depot, as well as being steam hauled they are also occasionally hired out for diesel hauled railtours. They also have some ex-NIR and ex-CIE Mk2 stock, some of which formerly operated on the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise service.\n\nThe RPSI bought the eight withdrawn Gatwick Express Mk2 coaches and generator van from NIR, which are currently (2017) in store at Dundalk and Whitehead. They will be used to augment and to replace some of the RPSI's current Mk2 fleet that work out of Whitehead. The DBSO entered preservation at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway on 27 September 2014, having never carried a passenger in NIR service or having left York Road depot by rail.\n\nRepublic of Ireland\nIn 1972 CI\u00c9 placed an order with BREL for 72 coaches based on the Mark 2D. With air conditioning as a principal feature they became known as \"AC Stock\" and ran on type B4 bogies, with vacuum brakes.\nThe order consisted of six First Class coaches (5101\u20135106), nine Composites (5151\u20135159), 36 Standard Class (5201\u20135236), eleven Restaurant/Buffet Standard Class (5401\u20135411) and eleven Generator Vans (5601\u20135611). Internal fit-out was done in Inchicore, and was quite different from the original BR design, using bench seating rather than individual seats and with extensive use of wood veneer panelling.\n\nTheir electrical system differed from the BR and NIR versions. The generator van contained two engine/generator sets, each supplying 220/380 V 50\u00a0Hz AC to two separate electrical buses in the train. The air conditioning loads were divided in half, each half fed from a separate bus. In the case of failure of one generator set, the other set automatically supplies both buses. Air conditioning output power would then be halved, but all other loads including cooking, lighting and battery charging would continue to be supplied. This later remained the model for the electrical power supply on all subsequent IE coaches.\n\nTo accommodate changes in traffic, five of the Composites (5153\u20135156, 5158) were re-classed as Standards, and Restaurant/Buffet Standard 5408 was converted for use as the Presidential Coach.\n\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann purchased fifteen carriages from a UK scrap dealer during 1989, in exchange for a similar number of scrap diesel locomotives. Older Mark 2A/B/C carriages were scrapped in 2004, as they were heavily corroded.  A few were preserved (minus bogies) at certain heritage railways in Ireland.\n\nThe remaining Mark 2 carriages (the 1972 vintage Mk2d sets) were phased out during 2007 and 2008, with the last set operating its final service, the 0505 Athlone\u2013Heuston, on 31 March 2008. Two of these coaches, 5106 and 5203, were preserved by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland. The Presidential Coach, 5408, has also been preserved by the RPSI.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNew Zealand operates 144 refurbished former Mark 2D, 2E, and 2F First Open and Tourist Standard Open carriages on its railway lines. The first 16 were exported in January 1997. Although New Zealand railway lines have a narrower rail gauge of , the country has a similar loading gauge, allowing regauged BR carriages to run on most lines. The first carriages were imported in 1996 by then rail operator Tranz Rail and heritage operator Mainline Steam. The first seven refurbished carriages entered regular service on 15 November 1999, on the Capital Connection service between Palmerston North and Wellington.\n\nUntil 2015, the former British Rail carriages ran virtually all carriage regional commuter services. Most of them (104) operated in Auckland, classified SA (81) and SD (23), in push-pull commuter trains, with three to five SA carriages, a SD driving carriage (similar to the original Mark 2 DBSOs), and a DC class (four- and five-car) or DFT class (six-car) diesel-electric locomotive. However, Auckland has since replaced its entire suburban fleet with the purpose-built New Zealand AM class electric multiple unit. Other BR Mark 2 carriages operate on the Capital Connection (8\u00d7 S class), and the Wairarapa Connection between Masterton and Wellington (18\u00d7 SW class). There are also six SE class carriages, which were used with electric locomotives on Wellington commuter services between 2008 and 2011 as a temporary measure until new EMUs were delivered. The carriages were reassigned to the Wairarapa Connection in June 2013, where peak service patronage was starting to exceed the capacity of the SW carriage fleet. Mainline Steam also own four refurbished carriages, classified ML, which are based in Plimmerton (north of Wellington) and are used for its steam-hauled excursions.\n\nAll New Zealand Mark 2 carriages retain their original BR running numbers.\n\nTaiwan (Republic of China)\n\nFollowing a decision to electrify Taiwan's busy West Coast Main Line, thirteen 5 car electric multiple units based on the Mark 2 design were built by BREL in York for the Taiwan Railway Administration in 1976, but following problems with the electrical equipment and excessive weight could not enter service until 1979 following the completion of remedial works. They used GEC electrical equipment and were built for  track gauge. They were used on the Tze-Chiang Limited Express service. They were withdrawn from service in 2009.\n\nKenya\nCarriages based on the Mark 2 design were built by BREL for the Kenya Railways Corporation in the late 1970s.\n\nNumbers built (BR stock)\n\nModels\n\nOO gauge\nOver the years the British Railways Mark 2 design has been manufactured by many of the British model railway manufacturers.\n\nHornby introduced Mk.2 BFK and TSO models in the late 1960s and these have remained in production intermittently ever since, sometimes being used to represent coaches of later variants (such as the Mk.2B BFK in the Royal Train). In 2013 (for the 2014 range) Hornby announced that it would produce the Mk2E variant. These are re-tooled versions and will be available in both their main range and their RailRoad range. Some from the main range will have interior lighting. Hornby are making three versions of the Mk2E i.e. FO, TSO and BSO.\n\nAirfix introduced Mk.2D BSO, FO and TSO models in the late 1970s, these going on to be produced by successors Mainline, Dapol and ultimately Hornby. The Airfix Mk.2D was a high quality model for its day, being more accurately detailed than most contemporary products, and it is still being produced by Hornby.\n\nLima produced Mk.2B BFK, FK and TSO and mk.2E FO and TSO models. These were approximately 1\u00a0cm under scale length, and have not been produced since the Lima business was taken over by Hornby.\n\nBachmann introduced Mk.2 and Mk.2A BFK, BSO, FK and TSO models in the early 2000s, these being more detailed than the various older models. Bachmann have also announced new Mk.2F BSO, DBSO, FO, RFB and TSO models for production in 2013-14.\n\nN gauge\nGraham Farish produce Mk.2F BSO, FO, RFB and TSO models and have announced upgraded models including a DBSO for 2013-14.  Mk.2A BSO, FK and TSO models were announced in 2012-13.\n\nReferences\n\n Michael Harris British Rail Mark 2 Coaches - the design that launched InterCity Venture Publications\n\nExternal links\nSouthern e-group page on Mark 2a/b/c\n\n Mark 2\nCategory:Railway coaches of New Zealand\nCategory:Train-related introductions in 1964", "Darreh Doran Rural District\n\nDarreh Doran Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in the Central District of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

The sect, or sub-sect, traced its philosophical roots to the eccentric Zen master Puhua, as well as similarities and correspondences with the early Linji House and previous Ch\u00e1n traditions\u2014particularly Huineng's \"Sudden Enlightenment\" (Southern Ch\u00e1n)\u2014in Tang Dynasty China.  \n\nFuke monks or priests (komus\u014d) were noted for playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute as a form of meditation known as suizen (\"blowing meditation\"), an innovation from the earlier zazen (\"sitting meditation\") of other Zen sects. Fuke Zen was characterized in the public imagination of Japan by its monks' playing of the shakuhachi flute while wearing a large woven basket hat that covered their entire head as they went on pilgrimage.\n\nThe theoretical basis of Fuke-sh\u016b was to emphasise the concept of the incommunicable aspect of enlightenment, an ideal traced to various Buddhist sects and relayed in paradoxical Zen writings such as the Lankavatara Sutra, the Diamond Sutra and Bodhidharma's \"Bloodstream sermon\". Thus Fuke monks rarely chanted sutras or other Buddhist texts, but rather relied upon scores of sacred shakuhachi music called honkyoku to express and transmit awakening.\n\nThe sect technically continues to exist (albeit in a less organized form) through the lineage of the contemporary Kyochiku Zenji Hosan Kai (KZHK) group in Kyoto\u2014which organizes annual meetings for hundreds of shakuhachi players, Rinzai clerics, and Fuke Zen enthusiasts\u2014and the related My\u014dan Society, as well as other small groups throughout Japan. KZHK and the My\u014dan Society operate from their base temples of T\u014dfuku-ji and My\u014dan-ji, the latter being the former headquarters of the Fuke sect. Many Rinzai monks still practice as komus\u014d during certain celebrations in former Fuke-sh\u016b temples that have, since the 19th century, reverted to traditional Rinzai Zen. Notable temples include Kokutai-ji and Ichigatsu-ji.\n\nAt least several particular individuals in modern times have been known to pursue temporary itinerant lifestyles as komus\u014d, for spiritual or learning purposes. H\u00f5zan Murata, a famous shakuhachi player, maker, and dai-shihan (grandmaster), lived as a komus\u014d for 8 months in 1974. Perhaps the most well known contemporary komus\u014d are Kok\u016b Nishimura\u2014who famously carried on the tradition of dubbing shakuhachi kyotaku (\"empty bell\"), in reference to the legend of Puhua (Fuke)\u2014and Watazumi Doso, known for his innovations with and revitalization of the shakuhachi repertoire, and the popularization of the hotchiku.\n\nThe Founder Puhua\n\n \n\nFuke-sh\u016b, according to some accounts, is derived from the teachings of the Chinese Zen teacher Linji Yixuan (c. 800\u2013866), known in Japan as Rinzai Gigen. However, the Fuke school counted as its founder one of Linji's contemporaries P\u01d4hu\u00e0 (\u666e\u5316), whose name is read as Fuke in Japanese. Puhua was reputedly a multi-talented monk, known for being inventive and at the same time quite strict. The notion of Puhua as founder is also supported by several references in the Record of Linji, as well as the Kyotaku Denki. (Although the latter was later confirmed as a fabrication used to further the komus\u014ds' benefits under the Tokugawa shogunate.)\n\nOne story of Puhua particularly demonstrates his unique style of nonverbal Ch\u00e1n:\n\nWhen Panshan Baoji was near death, he said to the monks, \"Is there anyone among you who can draw my likeness?\"\n\nMany of the monks made drawings for Panshan, but none were to his liking.\n\nThe monk Puhua stepped forward and said, \"I can draw it.\"\n\nPanshan said, \"Why don't you show it to me?\"\n\nPuhua then turned a somersault and went out.\n\nPanshan said, \"Someday, that fellow will teach others in a crazy manner!\"\n\nHaving said these words, Panshan passed away.\n\nMany stories about Puhua that appear in the Record of Linji add to his reputation of having a rough and uncompromising manner of expressing the dharma. For example:\n\n44.a. One day the master (Linji Yixuan) and Puhua went to a vegetarian banquet given them by a believer. During it, the master asked Puhua: \"'A hair swallows the vast ocean, a mustard seed contains Mt. Sumeru' \u2013 does this happen by means of supernatural powers, or is the whole body (substance, essence) like this?\" Puhua kicked over the table. The master said: \"Rough fellow.\" Puhua retorted: \"What place is this here to speak of rough and refined ?\"\n\nb. The next day, they went again to a vegetarian banquet. During it, the master asked: \"Today's fare, how does it compare with yesterday's?\" Puhua (as before) kicked over the table. The master said: \"Understand it you do \u2013 but still, you are a rough fellow.\" Puhua replied: \"Blind fellow, does one preach of any roughness or finesse in the Buddha-Dharma?\" The master stuck out his tongue.\n\nThere is some controversy as to the degree and nature of his musical talents, but his followers would often reflect on a certain story for inspiration: the story describes Puhua going through his hometown, ringing a bell to summon others to enlightenment. The same, for many Fuke practitioners, applied to the shakuhachi, and its mastery was seen as a path to enlightenment.\n\nDeath of Puhua\nThe death of Puhua is recounted in the Record of Linji. In addition to giving a special importance to Puhua's ringing bell, it is particularly striking as a story of Buddhist resurrection that equals the famous resurrection story of Bodhidharma, the Indian master who brought the Ekayana school from India to China, which became the Chan sect of Buddhism. The story:\n\n65. One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give him a robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The master Linji made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to him: \"There, I had this robe made for you.\" Fuke shouldered the coffin, and went back to the street market, calling loudly: \"Rinzai had this robe made for me! I am off to the East Gate to enter transformation\" (to die). The people of the market crowded after him, eager to look. Fuke said: \"No, not today. Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation.\" And so for three days. Nobody believed it any longer. On the fourth day, and now without any spectators, Fuke went alone outside the city walls, and laid himself into the coffin. He asked a traveler who chanced by to nail down the lid.\n\nThe news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell.\n\nFuke lineage in Japan\nFuke Zen was brought to Japan by Shinchi Kakushin (\u5fc3\u5730\u89ba\u5fc3)(1207\u20131298), also known as Muhon Kakushin (\u7121\u672c\u89ba\u5fc3) and posthumously as Hotto Kokushi (\u6cd5\u71c8\u570b\u5e2b).  Kakushin had travelled to China for six years and studied with the famous Chinese Chan master Wumen (\u7121\u9580) of the Linji lineage. Kakushin became a disciple of Ch\u00f4san, a 17th generation teacher of the Fuke sect of China.\n\nAlthough it no longer exists as a religious organization, during the feudal period, Fuke Zen's following was quite extensive.  Its members could be easily recognized by their practice of playing the shakuhachi flute, which was considered a form of meditation, termed suizen (\u5439\u79aa).  These musician-monks were known at first as komos\u014d (\u85a6\u50e7; literally \"straw-mat monks\") and, by the mid-17th century, as komus\u014d (\u865a\u7121\u50e7; literally \"emptiness monk\").\n\nFuke Zen in general stressed pilgrimage, and its adherents were mostly lay-practitioners rather than clergymen. During the Edo period (1603\u20131867), many r\u014dnin became incorporated into the sect, and due to the temperaments of these former samurai, the sect gained the reputation of harbouring troublemakers. Members of the Fuke sect were also given permission by the Bakufu government of the time to travel freely throughout the country, a significant dispensation considering the severe travel restrictions of the time. In reality, some of the Fuke monks were spies for the Bakufu government, a practice which helped seal the sect's demise when the government itself fell.\n\nDevelopment and demise\n\nFuke, which had initially been a loose affiliation of monks and lay pilgrims, solidified as a sect around 1700.  However, the sect died out in 1871 following the Meiji Restoration. The new government promulgated a grand council proclamation banning the practice of Fuke Zen and playing the shakuhachi for religious reasons. This is because, as described above, in practice many of the Fuke were spies and informers for the government. Practice of the shakuhachi was banned entirely for four years by the Meiji government, after which it was decreed that secular playing was permitted. From that time onward the playing of original Fuke pieces, honkyoku, made a very slow recovery. The recovery is continuing to this day.\n\nSee also \n\n Puhua\n Shakuhachi\n Honkyoku\n Hotchiku\n Suizen\n Zen\n Rinzai\n \u014cbaku\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nFerguson, Andy.

He was educated at Harrow School, London, England.\n\nCricket\nHe made his debut for Yorkshire County Cricket Club against Leicestershire in the County Championship in August 1911, one of six matches he played for the county that month. He played against the touring South Africans and Worcestershire in August the following year, and against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in September to round out his nine match Yorkshire first-class career. His final two matches came for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI against Oxford and Cambridge Universities at The Saffrons, Eastbourne, in the final summer before the start of World War I.\n\nHe was not prolific in the first-class arena. His best innings was a knock of 36 against Middlesex at Bradford, while his solitary first-class wicket was that of J. W. Hitch, the Surrey and England all-rounder. He also played for the Yorkshire Second XI, and in country house cricket for the Yorkshire Gentlemen.\n\nMilitary service\n\nAfter gaining his pilots licence on a Vickers biplane at Brooklands in June 1914, he was commissioned into the Royal Naval Air Service on the outbreak of war as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant, being confirmed in his rank on 16 September, and was promoted to flight lieutenant on 31 December. In April 1915 he attacked two German submarines lying at anchor alongside the Mole at Zeebrugge with four bombs \"with successful results.\"  Later that summer, on 7 June he attacked the Zeppelin shed at Evere, north of Brussels in a daring night attack, a mission for which he and his co-pilot J. S. Mills, were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. On 1 January 1916, Wilson was promoted to flight commander, and on 31 December to squadron commander. He was made a Chevalier of the Belgian Order of the Crown on 29 August 1917. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and Wilson joined the new service with the equivalent rank of major. In the 1919 New Year Honours, announced on 1 January 1919, he was awarded the Air Force Cross \"in recognition of distinguished service\". On 22 March 1919 Wilson relinquished his commission \"on account of ill-health\". He was allowed to retain his rank.\n\nPost-war life\nAlthough he continued in club cricket after the war, his new claim to fame came as an amateur steeplechase jockey. He rode more than 200 winners, rode in Grand National three times, and won on Double Chance in 1925.\n\nHe died in October 1959 in Tickton, Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1915 he married Louisa Harrison-Broadley. His wife's elder sister was married to Stanley Jackson, former England cricket captain; Jackson thus became Wilson's brother-in-law.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCricket Archive\nCricinfo\n\nCategory:1889 births\nCategory:1959 deaths\nCategory:People educated at Harrow School\nCategory:People from Ryedale (district)\nCategory:Royal Naval Air Service aviators\nCategory:British World War I flying aces\nCategory:Cricketers from Yorkshire\nCategory:Yorkshire cricketers\nCategory:English jockeys\nCategory:Royal Navy officers of World War I\nCategory:Royal Air Force personnel of World War I\nCategory:English cricketers\n\nCategory:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)\nCategory:Recipients of the Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)\nCategory:Knights of the Order of the Crown (Belgium)\nCategory:H.

After nearly five years' service as a tenor at Canterbury Cathedral, he performed in Arthur Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe in 1891. He then became principal tenor with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1898. There he created several roles, including the tenor roles in the last two Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He was also a composer who had a number of songs published in the 1890s. From 1898 to 1906, he toured in Australia and New Zealand with the J. C. Williamson opera company.\n\nEarly career\n\nKenningham was born in Hull, England. He began his musical career as a boy soprano soloist, at the age of eight, at Holy Trinity Church in Hull. Two years later he was principal boy chorister at St Paul's Cathedral in London, where he studied the organ with John Stainer. After his voice changed, he became the organist and choir master at St Luke's Church, Hull, at the age of age fourteen. After an engagement with a short-lived stage company he enlisted in the 5th Dragoon Guards. With that military company, he travelled to Egypt in 1882, taking part in two engagements. He then returned to England, where he was stationed at York and gave organ recitals, earning enough from them to purchase his military discharge.\n\nKenningham's London stage debut was at the Adelphi Theatre in 1882 as Duvalor in a single matin\u00e9e performance of Haydn Millars's operetta Mariette's Wedding. He was appointed principal tenor at Canterbury Cathedral, where he sang for almost five years. He went on to create the role of Maurice de Bracy in Sir Arthur Sullivan's grand opera, Ivanhoe, at the Royal English Opera House from January to July 1891.\n\nD'Oyly Carte Company\nIn August 1891 Kenningham joined a D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring company as Indru in The Nautch Girl. He replaced Courtice Pounds as Indru at the Savoy Theatre in October 1891 before returning to the Royal English Opera House to play Jeban D'Eveille in La Basoche by Andr\u00e9 Messager, and reprising his role as de Bracy in Ivanhoe for six performances during November and December 1891. Kenningham rejoined D'Oyly Carte on tour in March 1892 in the role of the Reverend Harry Sandford in The Vicar of Bray. Returning to the Savoy Theatre in September 1892, he created the parts of Oswald in Haddon Hall, Tom in Jane Annie, and Captain Fitzbattleaxe in Gilbert and Sullivan's penultimate opera, Utopia, Limited.\n\nWhen Courtice Pounds returned to the Savoy Theatre in July 1894 to take the tenor lead in Mirette, Kenningham rejoined the D'Oyly Carte touring company as Fitzbattleaxe until October 1894, leaving to create the part of Erling in W. S. Gilbert and Osmond Carr's His Excellency at the Lyric Theatre from October 1894 to April 1895. Kenningham returned to D'Oyly Carte in July 1895 to tour as Cyril in Princess Ida, Fitzbattleaxe in Utopia Limited, and Count Vasquez in The Chieftain.\n\nKenningham returned to the Savoy Theatre as Nanki-Poo in The Mikado in November 1895, a revival that lasted until March 1896, when he created the part of Ernest Dummkopf in the last Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Grand Duke. He remained at the Savoy until May 1898, and appeared successively as Nanki-Poo from July 1896 to February 1897, Prince Max in His Majesty from February to April 1897, and Colonel Fairfax in The Yeomen of the Guard from May to November 1897. He played Fritz in D'Oyly Carte's revival of The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein, from December 1897 to March 1898, and Marco in The Gondoliers from March to May 1898.\n\nSongwriting and later years\nIn the 1890s Kenningham composed the music of several songs, including the ballad \"Without thy love\" (to lyrics written by a fellow D'Oyly Carte performer, Wallace Brownlow), \"Scarborough Sal\" and \"I Dream of the Days\". He wrote both the words and the music for \"Can it be Love\" and \"Love of my Life 'tis You\". His song \"Since thou hast come\", to lyrics by H Cornell, was sung by Ivor McKay at the inaugural concert of The Proms in August 1895.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1906, Kenningham toured in Australia and New Zealand for J. C. Williamson, who had bought the rights to produce the Gilbert and Sullivan operas there from Richard D'Oyly Carte. Kenningham performed in the leading tenor roles in The Yeomen of the Guard, H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, The Sorcerer, Patience, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Mikado, The Gondoliers and Utopia, Limited. He also played Lancelot in La poup\u00e9e in 1899 and Donegal in Florodora in 1900.\n\nKenningham died in Australia at the age of 64.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nReviews of Kenningham in The Grand Duke\nKenningham in Australia\nA Charles Kenningham Photo Album\nKenningham and Utopia Limited in New Zealand\n\nCategory:1860 births\nCategory:1925 deaths\nCategory:Artists from Kingston upon Hull\nCategory:English opera singers\nCategory:English composers\nCategory:Musicians from Kingston upon Hull\nCategory:19th-century English singers", "St. Boniface Catholic Church (Sioux City, Iowa)\n\nSt. Boniface Catholic Church  is a parish of the Diocese of Sioux City. The church is located in a residential area west of downtown Sioux City, Iowa, United States. The parish buildings form a nationally recognized historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as St. Boniface Historic District. At the time of its nomination it contained three resources, all of them contributing buildings.\n\nHistory\nIn December 1885 a meeting was held by German Catholics in Sioux City to form a new parish. It was the second parish in the city. They purchased two lots on the corner of West Fifth and Main Streets for $1,500. The Rev. John A Gerleman was appointed the parish's first pastor on Christmas Eve 1886. A small frame church was built and the first Mass in the church was celebrated on July 17, 1887. The parish school opened the same year with Franciscan Sisters from Dubuque, Iowa teaching in the school.\n\nThe parish was started when Sioux City was still in the Diocese of Dubuque. It became a parish in the Sioux City diocese when it was formed in 1902. In 1906 Franciscan Friars from the Sacred Heart Province started serving the parish. That year the Rev. Seraphin Lampe, OFM, became the pastor that year and plans were made for a new church. A new church and rectory were built on West Fifth Street between Omaha and Cook Streets. Brother Leonard Darschield, OFM, designed the new church in the Romanesque Revival style. The new church was dedicated by Bishop Philip Garrigan on September 4, 1911. That same a year a new convent for the sisters was built. It was also designed by Brother Leonard and looked similar to the church and rectory. It was torn down in 1993 to add parking spaces after a fire gutted its interior.\n\nThe present school building and heating plant were designed by prominent Sioux City architect William LaBarthe Steele, and completed in 1924. The Sisters of the Living Word started staffing the school in 1975. In 1986 the Franciscan Friars left the parish and were replaced by priests from the diocese. The schools from St. Boniface, St. Joseph, and the Cathedral of the Epiphany consolidated in 1987 to form Holy Family School. Subsequently, the three parishes have been clustered as well. Weekend Masses are celebrated in St Boniface Church in English and Spanish.\n\nArchitecture\nThe church building measures  with a  tower over the front Gable. At the time it was built, St. Boniface Church was the tallest structure in Sioux City. The exterior is clad with brick from Buffalo, New York and the trim is in Bedford limestone. The building features a symmetrical facade of three bays, four roof dormers each on the north and south elevations, and a rounded apse on the east elevation. The 66 stained glass windows in the church include round-arch widows and a rose window. They were produced in Munich, Germany in 1910. The interior features a rib vaulted ceiling that rises  above the floor. The original wood altars were carved by a Franciscan brother. Statues of St. Boniface and St. Patrick are located on the high altar, while statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph are on the side altars. A social hall is located in the basement. The attached rectory is a 2\u00bd-story front gable residence that features the same detailing and materials as the church.\n\nThe two-story brick school building was designed to reflect the style of the church. It features a projecting center bay on its north elevation that includes the main entrance. It has a flat roof. The building has been altered over the years. The simple, two-story brick power plant was built at the same time as the school. It is located directly behind the school building and it includes a  tall concrete smokestack.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Parish website\n\nCategory:German-American culture in Iowa\nCategory:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1911\nCategory:Romanesque Revival church buildings in Iowa\nCategory:Roman Catholic churches in Sioux City, Iowa\nCategory:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa\nCategory:National Register of Historic Places in Sioux City, Iowa\nCategory:Religious organizations established in 1886\nCategory:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa\nCategory:Historic districts in Sioux City, Iowa", "Agapanthia lais\n\nAgapanthia lais is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It is a medium-sized, dark to rusty-brown haired subspecies with long and relatively narrow lacrimal bones. In Northern Italy, artificially introduced S. s. scrofa have extensively interbred with the smaller sized indigenous S. s. majori populations since the 1950s.\n\nThe boar features prominently in Scandinavian, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture, with its image having been frequently engraved on helmets, shields and swords. According to Tacitus, the Baltic Aesti featured boars on their helmets, and may have also worn boar masks. The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the Celts, who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some Celtic deities linked to boars include Moccus and Veteris. It has been suggested that some early myths surrounding the Welsh hero Culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god. Nevertheless, the importance of the boar as a culinary item among Celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the Asterix series, as wild boar bones are rare among Celtic archaeological sites, and the few that occur show no signs of butchery, having probably been used in sacrificial rituals.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:Mammals described in 1758\nCategory:Pigs\nCategory:Mammals of Europe\nCategory:Wild boars", "The Psychotechnic League\n\nThe Psychotechnic League is a future history created by American science fiction writer Poul Anderson.  The name \"Psychotechnic League\" was coined by Sandra Miesel in the early 1980s, to capitalize on Anderson's better-known Polesotechnic League future history.  Anderson published 21 novels, novellas and short stories set in this future between 1949 and 1957, with a 22nd published in 1968.\n\nAnderson did not write the stories in chronological order; instead, as Robert A. Heinlein did with his own Future History stories, he wrote whichever story in the series he wanted to, and trusted his readers to make the connections between them.  Anderson included a series timeline in the Winter 1955 issue of Startling Stories to accompany the novella \"The Snows of Ganymede\".\n\nBy the late 1950s, Anderson's political beliefs had altered to the point where he was uncomfortable with the political philosophy underlying the series, and he abandoned it. In particular, he had completely reversed his earlier strong support for the United Nations as the nucleus of a world government, a stance which formed the main plot element of several earlier stories in the series.\n\nPsychotechnic League future history\n\nOutline of events\nAnderson's future history begins with an all-out nuclear war in the late 1950s that nearly destroys civilization.\n\nSandra Miesel wrote a new prologue that was added to the series' republication in the 1980s and formally transformed it from future history into alternate history. Her prologue took the divergence point from our own history as the (premature) death of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 (in our world he died in 1969), and the assumption of power by a younger, hotheaded Richard Nixon, which led to exacerbation of the Cold War and a devastating nuclear war in 1958.\n\nIn the war's aftermath, a science called psychodynamics is created.  Like Isaac Asimov's psychohistory, psychodynamics can be used to predict and guide the future course of social evolution.  An organization called the Psychotechnic Institute is founded in the 1970s that uses psychodynamics to influence government policy and popular attitudes, with the goal of redirecting society towards greater rationality and internationalism.  The Psychotechnic Institute assists a reborn United Nations based in Rio de Janeiro to become a world government, and also encourages space colonization.  The Order of Planetary Engineers is established on the Moon with the goal of assisting in the terraforming of the Solar System.  Early in the 22nd century, as the settlements on the Moon, Venus, Mars, and the Asteroid Belt grow in importance, the United Nations is succeeded by the Solar Union.\n\nBy the late 22nd century, the Psychotechnic Institute becomes a victim of its own success.  An automated economy has created massive unemployment, which gives rise to an antitechnology movement called Humanism (a term having little to do with the historical philosophy of Humanism, and is indeed in many ways antithetical to it).  Around 2170, the Humanists seize control of Earth, withdraw from the Solar Union, and abolish the Psychotechnic Institute.  The Humanist regime quickly grows unpopular, and is overthrown by a popular uprising aided by Mars and Venus.  However, the Psychotechnic Institute is not revived, and, in its absence, technic civilization begins a slow and steady descent into extremism which results in a new dark age starting in the 24th century.\n\nThe Second Dark Ages lift in the 27th century, followed by the discovery of a form of faster-than-light travel that leads to interstellar colonization and commerce, and the creation of the Stellar Union and its enforcement agency, the Coordination Service.\n\nEleven of the stories in the Psychotechnic League series take place before the Second Dark Ages, and eleven take place after; none take place during the Second Dark Ages.\n\nThe perception of human history as composed of civilizations which arise, flourish, and fall, followed by a dark age and the rise of a new civilization, was also the basis of Anderson's later future history with the Polesotechnic League followed by the Terran Empire. Specifically, the situation depicted in \"Brake\" - with the protagonists heroically managing to put off, but unable to prevent, the inevitable destructive collapse of their civilization - clearly foreshadows the atmosphere of the Dominic Flandry series.\n\nReviews\nReviewer Vincent Carter noted that \"Like much of the Science Fiction written previous to the advent of actual space programs, Poul Anderson's early future history grossly underestimated the cost in money and material resources of even the smallest and shortest venture outside Earth's atmosphere.(\u2026) In \"Marius\" we meet Stephen Rostomily as already a combat veteran in a ravaged Europe, where even the basic necessities of life are scarce \u2013 and at that, Europe is relatively fortunate, with Russia and China having been reduced to \"howling cannibals\". Yet in reading \"The un-man\" we find that that ravaged world had been able to embark on a full-scale colonization of Mars, quickly enough for Rostomily to have spent most of his adult life there. Knowing what we know now about space programs and how much they cost, this is utter nonsense \u2013 unless, within a decade or so of the world-destroying war, this timeline managed to achieve anti-gravity or another miracle way of jumping at a low cost out of Earth's gravity well. Which is also highly implausible, to say the least. Otherwise, it is very unlikely that anyone would have conceived of spending scarce resources on space flight, and even the first Lunar landing would have had to wait until much later than 1969.\n\nPublication history\n\nOriginal publication\n1949\n \"The Entity\" (with John Gergen), June, Astounding\n1950\n \"Gypsy\", January, Astounding\n \"Star Ship\", Fall, Planet Stories\n \"Quixote and the Windmill\", November, Astounding\n1951\n \"The Acolytes\", February, Worlds Beyond\n1953\n \"Un-Man\", January, Astounding\n \"The Green Thumb\", February, Science Fiction Quarterly\n \"The Troublemakers\", September, Cosmos\n \"The Sensitive Man\", November, Fantastic Universe\n1954\n \"The Chapter Ends\", January, Dynamic\n \"Teucan\", July, Cosmos\n \"The Big Rain\", October, Astounding\n \"The Stranger Was Himself\", December, Fantastic Universe\n1955\n \"The Snows of Ganymede\", Winter, Startling\n \"What Shall It Profit?\", June, If\n \"Out of the Iron Womb\", Summer, Planet Stories\n1957\n \"Virgin Planet\", January, Venture\n \"Cold Victory\", May, Venture\n \"Marius\", June, Astounding\n \"Brake\", August, Astounding\n Star Ways, Ace\n1968\n \"The Pirate\", October, Analog\n\nSubsequent publication\nThe first component of the series to achieve book publication was Star Ways, which appeared as half of Ace Double D-255 in 1957.

The name was an homage to Anderson's better known future history series about the Polesotechnic League, a future interstellar version of the historical Hanseatic League.  The third volume also included a modified version of the timeline from Startling Stories.

He moved on to Newcastle the following year. He also played on loan for both Leek and Newcastle during his time at Vale. In January 2012, he moved up three divisions to play for Conference side Kidderminster Harriers. He was called up to the England C squad in May 2012, but did not win a cap. He was named on the Conference Team of the Year for the 2012\u201313 season. He switched to Stalybridge Celtic in June 2014, and the joined Kidsgrove Athletic in December 2014.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\nMalbon joined Port Vale as a youngster from Derby County in February 2008. He made his Football League debut as a substitute in a 2\u20131 win over Barnet on 2 May 2009. This came after picking up the club's Youth Player of the Year award the previous week. During the 2008\u201309 season, he scored 23 goals in the Youth league, and he was voted Youth Player of the Year by the Port Vale management. In February 2010 Malbon Joined Leek Town of the Northern Premier League Division One South for three games on a work experience deal. He scored a brace on his debut. He was offered his first (one year) professional contract at Vale Park at the end of the season.\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 pre-season, manager Micky Adams was pleased with Malbon's development, having witnessed the youngster score in two successive friendlies. The \"Valiants\" denied Leek the opportunity to sign the youngster permanently. In October 2010, Malbon went on loan to Newcastle Town, and impressed enough to earn an extension to the loan. In November 2010, Malbon left Port Vale by mutual consent. He immediately signed with Leek Town, rather than Newcastle Town. His scoring record at Leek attracted attention from Conference clubs. However a trial at Stockport County was ended after manager Ray Mathias was replaced by Dietmar Hamann. Malbon subsequently signed a one-year deal with Newcastle Town.\n\nKidderminster Harriers\nBoasting a prolific scoring record with Newcastle in 2011\u201312, Malbon was signed by Conference National side Kidderminster Harriers on an eighteen-month contract in January 2012; Kidderminster paid Newcastle Town an initial \u00a37,000 for his services. Manager Steve Burr thanked the \"Castle\" for allowing the deal, and stated that \"he comes across as a lad who really wants the opportunity to come and succeed here, and who is hungry to do that.\" He made his debut from the bench on 21 January, netting the first goal of a 2\u20130 win at Alfreton Town. On 28 April, he had to be airlifted from the pitch at Aggborough after he \"suffered a significant blow to his head and neck and was unconscious for a couple of minutes.\"\n\nHe signed a new two-year contract in March 2013, having hit a streak of 11 goals in 12 games to send Harriers to the top of the table. Malbon and strike partner Michael Gash finished the 2012\u201313 season as the division's joint-third highest scorers with 19 goals, helping Kidderminster to secure a play-off place with a second-place finish. At the end of the season he was voted onto the Conference Team of the Year, alongside teammates Lee Vaughan and Josh Gowling. He found goals more difficult to come by in the 2013\u201314 season as new manager Andy Thorn switched to a one striker system, leaving Malbon to sometimes feature from the bench or in midfield.\n\nStalybridge to Kidsgrove\nMalbon signed with Conference North club Stalybridge Celtic after having his contract with Kidderminster Harriers mutually terminated in June 2014. He made five appearances, scoring once, before he was released and joined Kidsgrove Athletic in December 2014. The \"Grove\" finished 20th in the Northern Premier League Division One South in 2014\u201315, 15th in 2015\u201316, and 12th in 2016\u201317. He rejected a move up a division to join Nantwich Town in February 2016. He scored 25 goals in the 2016\u201317 season. However he missed large parts of the 2017\u201318 season due to injury, whilst also began to adapt his game to become more of a target-man forward. Kidsgrove finished tenth in the 2018\u201319 season.\n\nInternational career\nHe was called up to the England C squad for the game against Russia on 5 June 2012.\n\nStatistics\n\nHonours\nIndividual\nConference Premier Team of the Year: 2012\u201313\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1991 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Sportspeople from Stoke-on-Trent\nCategory:English footballers\nCategory:England semi-pro international footballers\nCategory:Association football forwards\nCategory:Port Vale F.C. players\nCategory:Leek Town F.C. players\nCategory:Newcastle Town F.C. players\nCategory:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players\nCategory:Stalybridge Celtic F.C. players\nCategory:Kidsgrove Athletic F.C. players\nCategory:English Football League players\nCategory:National League (English football) players\nCategory:Northern Premier League players", "Teatro Lope de Vega (Seville)\n\nThe Lope de Vega Theatre () is a small Baroque Revival theatre that was built for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in Seville, Spain, in the same building as the Exhibition Casino.\nIt stands in the Maria Luisa Park just north of the Pavilion of Peru.\nThe theater is named after the famous 16th-century Spanish playwright Lope de Vega.\nAfter the exposition the theatre had a mixed history. It suffered damage from fire and flood. At times it was closed and at times was partially restored and reopened. The building has been used as a hospital and as a trade show venue. Following its most recent renovation the theatre has become one of Seville's most important centres for cultural events.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe Pabell\u00f3n de Sevilla (Pavilion of Seville) housing the theatre and casino was designed by the young architect Vicente Traver y Tom\u00e1s.\n\nHe chose a Baroque style that reflected Levantine influences.\nElements of Baroque architecture were used in the physical structure as well as in the ornamentation.\nThe theatre hall was fronted by the exhibition casino, which is roofed by a dome decorated in ceramics. The hall was laid out according to the canons of Italian opera, with two wings and 1,025 seats, and was one of the most modern theaters in Spain in its day. The decor by Mart\u00ednez del Cid y Zaragoza was dominated by red, with fine details in gold and ivory decorating the roof and railings, and with the door and furniture painted green.\n\nConstruction of the  theatre took just two years and included installation of an automatic electric generator which often failed, interrupting the performances.\nThe cost was 1.2\u00a0million pesetas, a huge amount at the time.\nThe theater was inaugurated on 30 March 1929 with a comedy by Martinez Serra entitled The Blind Heart (El Coraz\u00f3n Ciego).\nDuring the exhibition the building was illuminated, like other buildings of the exhibition, with powerful external spotlights that enhanced the attractive appearance of the hall.\n\nLater history\n\nAfter the exhibition, the theatre had ups and downs, competing with cinemas and football.\nIt was closed for a while, then re-opened as the Municipal Theatre Lope de Vega in 1936. The event was celebrated with a dance orchestra in the terrace beside the casino. The new opening did not last long.\nDuring the Civil War (1936\u20131939) the casino became a hospital, with the walls freshly painted white.\nA fire in the theater destroyed the central chandelier and all the seats. \nAlso, the Guadalquivir river overflowed to flood the pit.\n\nAfter the return of peace, in October 1939 the City Council decided to organise a season of opera. They cleaned the theatre, repaired the roof and installed indirect lighting. The theatre came back into use for opera and operetta, and was also used by amateur theatre groups and even schools. In 1961, renewed flooding again caused damage to the pit, and fresh renovations were required. In 1977 the theatre was assigned to the Ministry of Culture, and after a facelift became the National Theatre of Lope de Vega Sevilla. The theatre was used for a trade show in 1985.\n\nRecent years\n\nThe theatre was returned to the city of Seville in 1985, and over a two-year period the architect Victor Perez Escolano made significant alterations, returning the theatre to its original design, although this limited the number of spectators to 749.\nThe first performance after the reopening in February 1988 was a concert by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. From then on, the theatre has put on more than 180 performances every year to over 100,000 spectators.\nThe theatre today stages classical and modern plays and concerts, and flamenco shows. \nIt is a venue for the Flamenco Biennale of Seville, which is held on even-numbered years, and is among the most important theatres in Spain.\nAs of January 2009 further repairs were needed, especially to the casino dome which had tiles missing and was leaking.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Buildings and structures in Seville\nCategory:Theatres in Spain\nCategory:Theatres completed in 1929\nCategory:Tourist attractions in Seville", "Bonanseja\n\nBonanseja is a genus of fungi in the Rhytismatales order.

He was also a teacher and focused primarily on Japanese immigrant students. Some sources erroneously give his place of birth as Bandar, India.\n\nBiography\nHis father, Reinier Tadama (1844-1879) was a colonial administrator in Aceh. His mother was his father's mistress; a local woman. He was orphaned when his father died of tuberculosis while at a health spa in Germany.Having been taken to the Netherlands, he remained there and received his first artistic training from the landscape painter, Sieger Jan Baukema (1852-1936). Later, he attended the \"Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten\" in Amsterdam. In 1895, he married , who was also a painter. In 1897, they settled in Egmond aan den Hoef and became part of the , led by George Hitchcock. They both specialized in seascapes.\n\nIn 1898, they had a joint exhibition at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais in Paris. By now, the critics had come to consider Thamine as the better artist and Fokko worked mostly as her assistant. In 1900, he gave up painting; devoting his time to hunting and caring for his large dog kennel. In 1907, they relocated to Katwijk aan Zee. The progress of their relationship after that is unclear. Some sources say that she became mentally unsound and had to be institutionalized by 1910, but others indicate that she was exhibiting and winning awards as late as 1912. Yet others say she accompanied her husband to Seattle and returned to the Netherlands after his death. It can be assumed there were some clashes regarding their competing careers.\n\nWhatever the truth may be, in 1910 he emigrated to the United States, crossed the country, settled in Seattle and began painting again. In 1913, he held his first showing in one of the meeting rooms at the Seattle Public Library. The following year, he started his own art school. Perhaps because his name could be mistaken for Japanese, he soon became a mentor and patron for many Japanese immigrant artists, including Kenjiro Nomura, Yasushi Tanaka and Shimizu Toshi, as well as the photographer, Soichi Sunami.    \n\nHe apparently had a very successful career, until the beginning of the Great Depression virtually destroyed the local demand for art. To make ends meet, he found employment as a mural painter with the WPA; taking part in the Federal Art Projects. Broke, despondent and in declining health, he committed suicide in 1937.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:1871 births\nCategory:1937 deaths\nCategory:Dutch painters\nCategory:Dutch emigrants to the United States\nCategory:Hague School\nCategory:Painters who committed suicide\nCategory:People from Banda Aceh", "Robert Heard\n\nRobert Lee Heard (April 10, 1930 \u2013 April 15, 2014) was an American writer, journalist and reporter for the Associated Press, who covered politics, government and sports news in Texas for the wire service. Heard was shot and wounded by Charles Whitman on August 1, 1966, while covering Whitman's attack on the University of Texas at Austin for the Associated Press. Heard received widespread praise for his series of reports on the integration of the Texas Longhorns football team. He also authored several books, focusing on sports and politics.\n\nEarly life \n\nRobert Heard was born in April 10, 1930, in Big Spring, Texas. His father was a Baptist preacher. He had three older brothers. Heard's parents, who had expected a baby girl, did not know what to name him. They decided to call him Robert Lee after General Robert E. Lee, at the urging of his two older brothers, who had just learned about the Civil War general in elementary school.\n\nCareer \n\nHeard served in the United States Marines in the Korean War from 1951 to 1952. He returned to Texas after the war, where he obtained a law degree from Baylor University. He practiced law in Houston for two years before pursuing a career change to journalism. He initially worked as a journalist at the Waco Tribune-Herald in Waco, Texas, and the AP Long Beach, California. Heard was then hired as a reporter by the Associated Press in 1964.\n\nOn August 1, 1966, Heard, who was 36 years old at the time, was shot in the arm while covering the mass shooting at the University of Texas at Austin. Heard, who had arrived on scene as a reporter for the Associated Press, was attempting to follow to Texas highway patrol offices across a parking lot when he was wounded by a bullet fired by Charles Whitman. In a 2006 interview with Texas Monthly, Heard recalled, \"Just before I reached the curb, I was shot down. I'd forgotten my Marine training; I hadn't zigzagged.\" He continued to grant interviews on the anniversary of the shooting, but attempted to distance his professional and personal life from the tragedy. According to his wife, Betsy Heard, \"He lived his whole life hoping to get that out of the first paragraph of his obituary.\"\n\nHeard eventually left the Associated Press, but continued to work in journalism and public relations. He worked as a press secretary for Joe Christie, a Democratic U.S. Senator candidate, during his campaign. Heard also wrote for the Texas Lawyer and served as the Texas State Capitol correspondent for the San Antonio Express News.\n\nHeard founded Inside Texas, a newsletter which covered athletics at the University of Texas.\nHis books included \"Dance With Who Brung Us: Quips & Quotes from Darrell Royal,\" which compiled quotes from Darrell Royal, a former Texas Longhorns football coach. Heard also authored \"Miracle of the Killer Bees: 12 Senators Who Changed Texas Politics,\" which focused on twelve Texas state senators who fled Austin in 1979 and went into hiding to stop a bill.\n\nPersonal life \n\nRobert Heard died from complications of hip surgery on April 15, 2014, at the age of 84.

It is currently competing in Albania's First Division, the 2nd tier of Albanian football. They play their home games at Besa Stadium.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years (1925\u20131944)\nKlubi Sportiv Besa was founded on 25 October 1925 originally as \"Shoqata Kulturore-Sportive Adriatiku\" which was a multi-disciplinary sports club based in Kavaj\u00eb, Albania. In 1930 the club changed its name to \"Sport Klub Kavaj\u00eb\".\nThat same year the football team played its first ever friendly at Mali i Robit, Golem against an amateur team formed of students from the Albanian-American Institute of Agriculture. A short time later SK Kavaj\u00eb joined the newly formed Albanian Football Association and participated in the 1930 second tier championship where they would repeat their participation for the next two seasons before joining the top tier Kategoria e Par\u00eb in 1933. In their first top flight championship SK Kavaj\u00eb finished last in the 5 team league, losing 7 games and winning just one, a 2\u20131 victory over local rivals Teuta Durr\u00ebs.\n\nIn 1935 the club took the shape of an organized one under the leadership of chairman Irfan Berati. The vice-chairman was Fehmi Kazazi, the secretary was Dervish Cara, the committee members were Sulejman Karkini and Reshat Asllani, the cashier was Rasim Sulejmani and Dhori Fora was in charge of the trade of craft. The following year, the club was renamed \"Besa Kavaj\u00eb\" also known as \"Besa Sport Klub\", derived from the name Besa, the Albanian cultural precept meaning \"to keep the promise\" and \"word of honor\".\n\nDuring World War II many members of the club lost their lives as soldiers, including Mehmet Babamusta, Adil Alushi, Sami Karriqi and Millan Radosalja. The activities of the club became very limited and support came primarily from the local residents of the city. There were no official competitions held in Albania at this time.\n\nRise (1945\u20131965)\nBut between 1945 and 1950 the club experienced a revival which was due to young talented players coming through the ranks of the youth teams, including the likes of Qamil Teliti who went on to receive national success. During the 1945\u201346 season the club won the unofficial Sports Federation President's Cup. Many of the club's players during the late 40s would go on to play for the Albanian national team, including Qamil Teliti, who scored the winning goal against Romania that won Albania the 1946 Balkan Cup.\n\nIn 1958 the club achieved a second-place finish in the top tier Albanian Championship, narrowly losing out to Partizani Tirana for the title by one point. Also during the 1958 season they reached the semi final of the Albanian Cup, again losing out to eventual winners Partizani Tirana. The club would go on to reach the finals of the Albanian Cup in 1961, losing to Partizani Tirana once again and also the following season in 1962\u201363, where they lost on penalties to KF Tirana. In 1963 Besa won the unofficial cup competition held by the 'Sport' newspaper, and in 1965 it won the 'Bashkimi' newspaper competition.\n\nGolden generation (1965\u20131975)\nThe period between 1965 and 1975 has been called the golden generation of football in Kavaj\u00eb, due to the domestic achievements especially in the Albanian Cup which resulted in the club's first ever European games. In 1971 they finished as runners-up in the Albanian Cup after losing 2\u20130 in the finals to Dinamo Tirana. They repeated this feat the following year, losing on penalties in the cup final following a 2\u20132 draw with Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr, but as Vllaznia also won the league in that same year, this gave Besa the opportunity to participate in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the 1972\u201373 season.\n\nTheir first European opponents were Danish side, Fremad Amager, who Besa managed to overcome on away goals following a 1\u20131 draw away in Copenhagen and a goalless draw at home. In the next round however they were beaten by Scottish side Hibernian, whom they lost to on aggregate 8\u20132, following a 7\u20131 away loss and a 1\u20131 draw at home. The end of the golden generation era was marked with the completion of the club's first purpose built stadium, Besa Stadium. Construction was completed in 1974 and the new stadium had a capacity to seat 9000 spectators.\n\nPresent time\nBesa confirmed their place in the 2007\u201308 UEFA Cup after a 3\u20132 win against neighbours KS Teuta in the 2006\u201307 Albanian Cup final. They met Be\u017eanija of Serbia in the first qualifying round, drawing 2\u20132 away and 0\u20130 at home to progress on away goals. In the second qualifying round they fell 3\u20130 in each leg to Bulgarian side Litex Lovech. In 2008, they qualified for the Intertoto Cup due to their third-place finish in the league, drawing Ethnikos Achna 0\u20130 at home and 1\u20131 in Cyprus and continued on away goals. In the 2nd round of the Intertoto cup they were eliminated by Grasshopper Z\u00fcrich from Switzerland.\n\nBesa in european competitions\nAs of October 2015\n\n 1QR = 1st Qualifying Round\n 2QR = 2nd Qualifying Round\n 1R  = 1st Round\n 2R  = 2nd Round\n 3R  = 3rd Round\n\nCurrent squad\n\nB Team\n\nHistorical list of coaches\n\n Rexhep Spahiu\n Muhamet Vila (1971-1973)\n Fatmir Frash\u00ebri (1981-1982)\n Dashnor Bajaziti (1985\u20131988)\n Bajram Hushi (1990\u20131991)\n Fisnik Kosova (1992\u20131993)\n Zihni Gjinali (1994)\n Fisnik Kosova (1994)\n Haki Arkaxhiu (1995)\n Azem Mullaliu (1995\u20131996)\n Artan Lilamani (1996)\n Bujar Pagria (1997)\n Edmond G\u00ebzdari (1997\u20131998)\n Naim Hushi (1998)\n Shk\u00eblqim Mu\u00e7a (1998\u20131999)\n Ilir Gjyla (1999\u20132000)\n Ramadan Shehu (2001)\n Faruk Sejdini (2001)\n Edmond G\u00ebzdari (2001)\n Haxhi Arkaxhiu (2002)\n Ramadan Shehu (2002)\n Abdyl Kuriu (2002)\n Ramadan Shehu (2002)\n Astrit Sejdini (2003)\n Ilir Gjyla (2003)\n Ilir Duro (4 Jan 2005\u00a0\u2013 28 Aug 2005)\n Agim Canaj (28 Aug 2005\u00a0\u2013 3 Dec 2005)\n Ilir Shulku (3 Dec 2005\u00a0\u2013 05 Apr 2006)\n P\u00ebrparim Daiu (05 Apr 2006\u00a0\u2013 30 Jun 2006)\n\n Hasan Lika (Jul 2006\u00a0\u2013 25 Sep 2006)\n P\u00ebrparim Daiu (25 Sep 2006\u00a0\u2013 20 Nov 2006)\n Vasil Bici (20 Nov 2006\u00a0\u2013 14 May 2007)\n Ylli Teliti (14 May 2007\u00a0\u2013 Jun 2007)\n Silviu Dumitrescu (Jul 2007\u00a0\u2013 29 Nov 2007)\n Iljaz Haxhiaj (29 Nov 2007\u00a0\u2013 3 Dec Jun 2007)\n Sulejman Starova (3 Dec 2007\u00a0\u2013 6 Apr 2008)\n Iljaz Haxhiaj (6 Apr 2008\u00a0\u2013 16 Sep 2008)\n Ilir Daja (16 Sep 2008\u00a0\u2013 22 Feb 2009)\n Ilir Biturku (22 Feb 2009\u00a0- Jun 2009)\n Shp\u00ebtim Duro (Jul 2009\u00a0- 20 Sep 2010)\n P\u00ebrparim Daiu (20 Sep 2010\u00a0\u2013 3 Nov 2010)\n Gerd Haxhiu (3 Nov 2010\u00a0\u2013 Jun 2011)\n Gugash Magani (Jul 2011\u00a0\u2013 Jun 2012)\n Ilir Daja (Jul 2012\u00a0- Feb 2013)\n P\u00ebrparim Daiu (Feb 2013\u00a0\u2013 May 2013)\n Ramadan Shehu (Jul 2013\u00a0\u2013 Aug 2013)\n Artan M\u00ebrgjyshi (Aug 2013\u00a0- 14 Nov 2014)\n Bledar Sinella (14 Nov 2014\u00a0- Apr 2015)\n Dorjan Bubeqi (Apr 2015\u00a0\u2013 Nov 2015)\n Ilir Gjyla (Mar 2016\u00a0- May 2016)\n Bekim Kuli  (28 Jul 2016\u00a0\u2013 ?)\n Ndri\u00e7im Kashami (Sep 2016\u00a0\u2013 Oct 2016)\n Julian Ahmataj (Oct 2016\u00a0\u2013 May 2017)\n Artion Po\u00e7i (Aug 2017\u00a0\u2013 Sep 2017)\n Bledar Sinella (Sep 2017\u00a0- May 2018)\n Gentian Begeja (26 Jun 2018\u00a0- Dec 2018)\n Gugash Magani (Jan 2019\u00a0\u2013 )\n\nHonours\nAlbanian Superliga\nRunners-up (2): 1958, 2009\u201310\n3rd Place (11): 1936, 1937, 1945, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1966\u201367, 1972\u201373, 1973\u201374, 1978\u201379, 1992\u201393, 2007\u201308\n\nAlbanian First Division\nWinners (4): 1932, 1977\u201378, 1985\u201386, 2004\u201305\nRunners-up (2): 1999\u201300, 2001\u201302\n\nAlbanian Cup\nWinners (2): 2007, 2010\nRunners-up (6): 1961, 1963, 1971, 1972, 1982, 1992\n\nAlbanian Supercup\nWinners (1): 2010\n\nRecords\n Biggest Victories: 9\u20131 vs Ismail Qemali (1937); 12\u20130 vs Bashkimi Elbasanas (1945); 7\u20130 vs Shkumbini (17.02.1963); 11\u20130 vs Apolonia Fier (1965); 8\u20131 vs Poli\u00e7ani (28.08.1991); 7\u20131 vs Tirana (1992)\n Biggest Defeats: 1\u20139 vs Sk\u00ebnderbeu (16.04.1933); 0\u20136 vs Partizani (09.02.1975); 1\u20137 vs Tirana (12.09.2003)\n Most points in a season: 56 (2007\u201308)\n Fewest points in a season: 1 (1948)\n Most ties in a season: 14 (1973\u201374, 1976\u201377, 1989\u201390)\n Fewest ties in a season: 0 (1933)\n Most losses in a season: 23 (2003\u201304)\n Fewest losses in a season: 3 (1958)\n Best Goal Differential: +27 (1937)\n Worst Goal Differential: -43 (2003\u201304)\n\nSponsors\n\nOfficial Kit Sponsor: PORTA KAVALJA\nOfficial Sponsor: BASHKIA KAVAJE\n\nSee also\n Golemi FC\n Luzi United\n FK Egnatia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBesa at UEFA.COM\nBesa at FIFA.COM\n\nCategory:Football clubs in Kavaj\u00eb\nCategory:Football clubs in Albania\nCategory:Association football clubs established in 1925\nCategory:1925 establishments in Albania", "Ken Hensley\n\nKenneth William David Hensley (born 24 August 1945) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer, best known for his work with Uriah Heep during the 1970s.\n\nHe wrote or co-wrote the majority of Uriah Heep's songs during this period, including the hit singles \"Lady in Black\" (on which he sang lead vocals), \"Easy Livin'\" and \"Stealin'\", as well as \"Look at Yourself\", on which he also sang lead vocals, and \"Free Me\".\n\nBiography\nBorn in Plumstead, south-east London, Hensley moved with his parents, three brothers and sister to Stevenage, Hertfordshire in 1945. He learned how to play guitar at the age of 12 from a Bert Weedon manual. His first gig was at The Mentmore Pen Factory, in Stevenage (September 1960). After that, he played with The Blue Notes, Ken and the Cousins and Kit and the Saracens (1962). In 1963, this band evolved into The Jimmy Brown Sound, and they recorded some now lost songs. At this time, Hensley's first \"professional\" opportunity almost came about: they were to back Ben E. King on a British visit, but it never happened.\n\nIn early 1965, Hensley formed a band called The Gods, with the young guitarist Mick Taylor, well known later for his work with John Mayall and The Rolling Stones. Hensley wrote most of the material, sang and played the Hammond B3 organ as the band already had the talented Mick Taylor on guitar. The Gods' line-up included, at one time or another, vocalist and guitar/bass player Greg Lake (later of King Crimson and Emerson, Lake & Palmer), bass player Paul Newton (later the first Uriah Heep bassist), drummer Lee Kerslake (later also of Heep), bassist John Glascock (later of Jethro Tull), and guitarist Joe Konas. In early 1968 they signed with Columbia Records and recorded two LPs and several singles. After that, Newton left the band to join Spice, an Essex-based band. Hensley also played on a one-album side project of The Gods initially planned to become their 3rd album, but was recorded and eventually released in 1969/1970 under the moniker Head Machine's \"Orgasm\". The album was produced by David Paramor (producer of \"The Gods\") and both Hensley and Kerslake featured, along with John Glascock on bass, Brian Glascock on drums, and David Paramor on vocals, all under pseudonyms. Hensley played mostly guitar again, as in the beginning of his career. Although Paramor was credited as composer, the songs bear many of Hensley's influences. The album was released before Hensley joined Toe Fat and might almost be considered a prototype for the harder side of his future work in Uriah Heep.\n\nThe band eventually split but Cliff Bennett, from the Rebel Rousers, decided to move in a more \"progressive\" direction and asked The Gods to join him. Under the name Toe Fat they released two LPs, but only the first featured Hensley.\n\nPaul Newton asked Hensley (Christmas 1969) to join forces in Spice, as they were looking for a keyboard player to make their sound less bluesy and more progressive, in keeping with the current trend. In January 1970, Spice changed its name into Uriah Heep. Also in the line-up were guitarist Mick Box and vocalist David Byron. With Uriah Heep, Hensley found a place to develop and showcase his songwriting and lyrical abilities as well as his keyboard and guitar playing. The band's \"classic\" line-up featured Hensley, Byron, Box, Kerslake and bassist Gary Thain, plus the management provided by Gerry Bron (Bronze Records). During his time with Heep (1970\u20131980), they recorded 13 studio albums, and the live album Uriah Heep Live \u2013 January 1973 along with many compilations and singles. Hensley also recorded his first two solo albums, Proud Words on a Dusty Shelf (1973) and Eager To Please (1975) during this time.  He was supported mainly by Mark Clarke and Bugs Pemberton.\n\nAfter the departure of bassist Gary Thain (who died in 1975) and vocalist David Byron, other musicians were brought into the Heep family: John Wetton (Family, King Crimson, Roxy Music, later of U.K. and Asia), Trevor Bolder (from Spiders From Mars, later of Wishbone Ash) and John Lawton (Lucifer's Friend), among others.\n\nIn 1980 Hensley left the band, unhappy with the musical direction they had chosen. After trying to put a new band together in the UK (Shotgun), he later moved to the USA and played a few gigs in North America as The Ken Hensley Band. Around this time he released his third solo LP, Free Spirit (1980).\n\nIn 1982 Hensley joined Blackfoot, a hard rock Florida-based band. With them, he recorded two albums (1983's Siogo and 1984's Vertical Smiles). Although the group achieved some success, Hensley left after Bron informed him of Heep vocalist David Byron's death in 1985.\n\nAfter 1985, Hensley lived in semi-retirement in St Louis, Missouri (USA), making a few appearances with W.A.S.P., Cinderella and others. W.A.S.P.'s frontman Blackie Lawless stated that \"Ken Hensley wrote the rule book for heavy metal keyboards as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nIn 1994, From Time To Time, a collection of lost recordings, was released featuring rare songs recorded by Hensley between 1971 and 1982, as well as some early versions of Heep's classic songs, played by Hensley and his roommates at that time, namely guitarist Paul Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke (both of Free). Other musicians on the songs were bassist Boz Burrell (King Crimson and Bad Company), guitarist Mick Ralphs (Bad Company), drummers Ian Paice (Deep Purple, Whitesnake) and Kenney Jones (The Who), amongst others.\n\nIn 1999, Hensley's musical activities began to increase, besides his work with St Louis Music. He recorded an album, A Glimpse of Glory, together with his band Visible Faith.\n\nDuring the fourth Uriah Heep Annual Convention in London, May 2000, plans were made for a one-off concert by the so-called \"Hensley/Lawton Band\". Hensley was joined by former Uriah Heep singer John Lawton, their first public collaboration since the latter's departure from Uriah Heep in 1979. With them were Paul Newton (the band's original bassist) and two members of Lawton's band, Reuben Kane on lead guitar and Justin Shefford on drums. They played a set of old Uriah Heep classics and some of Hensley's solo songs, and the concert was recorded for a CD release, followed by a tour in Europe culminating with a concert in Hamburg, Germany, featuring a full orchestra and a new rendition of Heep's old song \"Salisbury\".\n\nRunning Blind, his first effort in 21 years, was released worldwide in 2002 and followed by a world tour with his band called \"Free Spirit\", that included Dave Kilminster (guitar), Andy Pyle (bass) and Pete Riley (drums).\n\nAfter moving to Spain, Hensley released The Last Dance (with new songs), The Wizard's Diary (Uriah Heep classics re-recorded in 2004) and Cold Autumn Sunday (Hensley's solo songs re-recorded in 2005).\n\nFeaturing a number of special guests, the rock opera Blood on the Highway was released in May 2007. The story portrays the rise and fall of a rock'n'roll star. Lead vocals role were split between Hensley and Glenn Hughes (ex-Deep Purple, Trapeze, Black Sabbath), Jorn Lande (ex-The Snakes, Masterplan), John Lawton and Eve Gallagher.\n\nIn September 2008, Hensley went on stage again with former Heep bandmates Lawton, Kerslake and Newton along with ex-Focus guitarist Jan Dum\u00e9e, for the \"Heepvention 2008\" fans meeting.\n\nHensely continued to write and record a series of new albums, beginning with a collection of songs under the title of Love & Other Mysteries, recorded near his home in Spain and followed in 2011 by Faster, his first studio recording of new songs with his live band, Live Fire. A CD of one of his solo concerts was released by Cherry Red Records in 2013, shortly followed by a live CD recorded with Live Fire during a September/October tour. Trouble, an album of 10 new songs recorded with a revised Live Fire line-up was released, again by Cherry Red, in September the same year.\n\nFor the past few years, Hensley and his wife have lived in the village of Agost near Alicante in Spain.\n\nBands and guest appearances\n\n The Gods (1965\u20131969) \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, occasional guitar\n Head Machine (1969) \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, guitars (This was a one-album project put together by a producer.)\n Toe Fat (1969) \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals, occasional guitar\n Weed (1971) \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, guitars (A one-album side project for Hensley.

At the 2006 census, its population was 3,201, in 861 families. The rural district has 61 villages.\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:Rural Districts of Mazandaran Province\nCategory:Babol County", "Perak Stadium\n\nPerak Stadium () is a stadium located in Kampung Simee in Ipoh, Kinta District, Perak, Malaysia. It is part of a large complex called the DBI Sports Complex, which houses a majority of sporting facilities used by players representing the state of Perak such as the Velodrome Rakyat (cycling), Indera Mulia Stadium (indoor stadium) and the Sultan Azlan Shah Stadium (hockey).\n\nProfile \nBefore the stadium was built, the site for the stadium was used as a prison from 1949 to 1959, known as Detention Camp to incarcerate communists during Malayan Emergency period (Darurat in Malay).\n\nThe construction of the stadium started in January 1964 and completed by June 1965, with a maximum capacity of 10,000. Two following renovations increased the stadium capacity - 1975 (18,000) and 1993 (30,000).\n\nThe stadium was upgraded in 1997. for the FIFA U-20 World Cup. It was renovated in 1999 at a cost of RM 1,949,000 by the Perak state government. It was put under the administration of the Ipoh City Council, which oversees the general upkeep of the stadium until this day.\n\nSince the last refurbishment in 1997, the capacity of the stadium is 42,500 and it boasts a press box and a VIP-area which is normally used by the Sultan of Perak. The stadium features a FIFA standard football pitch and an IAAF-certified synthetic running track. The stadium also has monochromatic video matrix scoreboard.\n\nThe stadium has two types of seating, which is grandstand seating and normal seating. Only those seating in the grandstand are sheltered from the elements of nature.\n\nThe stadium has a notoriously problematic flood light system. There are four flood light towers surrounding the stadium and about 50% fail to light up when it is needed. Poor pitch conditions are also a norm at this stadium and coaches are known to have publicly voiced their discontent over this issue.\n\nHowever, the issue was settled comprehensively and the light towers are upgraded to international football standard. On 7 May 2013, Perak FA defeated Negeri Sembilan FA 2-1 in a Malaysian Super League match in the first sporting event after the stadium flood lights upgrading.\n\nUsage \nToday, the stadium is not regularly used for events other than football. Events such as military band competitions and school sports days are held at the Perak Stadium sporadically.\n\nThe Perak FA, which plays its football in the Malaysian Super League, considers Perak Stadium to be its homeground and their matches are the only times when the stadium experiences capacity crowds.\n\nIt is a preferred venue for football final matches when the teams involved do not originate near the Klang Valley area such as the Malaysia FA Cup final matches for 1997 (Selangor FA vs. Penang FA) and 2003 (Negeri Sembilan FA vs. Perlis FA). Some parties have criticised the Football Association of Malaysia for failing to move the finals of 2006 Malaysian FA Cup (Pahang FA vs. Perlis FA) to this stadium, where attendance levels were likely to be higher than the one eventually experienced at Bukit Jalil.\n\nThe stadium also held numerous final matches or championship for FAM Cup, Piala Emas Raja-Raja, Agong Cup, Burnley Cup and Bardhan Cup.\n\nSee also\n\n Sport in Malaysia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n https://web.archive.org/web/20140327083902/http://www.worldstadiums.com/asia/countries/malaysia.shtml\n http://www.mbi.gov.my/web/guest/sukan_rekreasi\n\nCategory:Football venues in Malaysia\nCategory:Athletics (track and field) venues in Malaysia\nCategory:Multi-purpose stadiums in Malaysia\nCategory:Buildings and structures in Ipoh\nCategory:Sports venues in Perak\nCategory:1965 establishments in Malaysia\nCategory:Perak TBG F.C.", "Nappi\n\nNappi may refer to:\n\nPeople \n Chiara Nappi, Italian physicist\n Frank Nappi, American author\n Marco Nappi, Italian footballer\n Michele Nappi, Italian footballer\n Romie Nappi, American mobster\n Valentina Nappi, Italian adult actress\n\nOther \nNational Pharmaceutical Product Index", "Bill Miller (bowls)\n\nWilliam 'Bill' McConnell Miller (1910-2004), was a Scottish born United States international lawn bowler.\n\nBowls career\nHe emigrated to the United States in 1928, joined the Gary Bowls Club in 1939 and became a United States citizen one year later in 1940.

The samaj was founded by the sannyasi (ascetic) Dayanand Saraswati on 10 April 1875. Members of the Arya Samaj believe in one God and reject the worship of idols.\n\nArya Samaj was the first Hindu organization to  introduce proselytization in Hinduism.\n\nFoundation\nThe Arya Samaj was established in Bombay on 10 April 1875 by Dayananda Saraswati (born \"Mool Shankar\" in Kathiawar, Gujarat 1824  died Ajmer, 1883)\n\nAn alternative date for the foundation of the samaj is 24 June 1877 because it was then, in Lahore when the samaj became more than just a regional movement based in Punjab.\n\nVedic schools\nBetween 1869 and 1873, Dayanand began his efforts to reform orthodox Hinduism in India. He established Gurukul (Vedic schools) which emphasised Vedic values, culture, Satya (virtue) and Sanatana Dharma (the essence of living). The schools gave separate educations to boys and girls based on ancient Vedic principles. The Vedic school system was also to relieve Indians from the pattern of a British education.\n\nThe first Vedic school was established at Farrukhabad in 1869. Fifty students were enrolled in its first year. This success led to the founding of schools at Mirzapur (1870), Kasganj (1870), Chhalesar (Aligarh) (1870) and Varanasi (1873).\n\nAt the schools, students received all meals, lodging, clothing and books free of charge. The discipline was strict. Students were not allowed to perform murti puja (worship of sculpted stone idols). Rather, they performed Sandhyavandanam (meditative prayer using Vedic mantras with divine sound) and agnihotra (making heated milk offering twice daily).\n \nThe study of Sanskrit scriptural texts which accepted the authority of the Vedas were taught. They included the Vedas, Upanishads, Aranyaka, Kashika, Nirukta, Mahabhasya, Ashtadhyayi, Darshanas.\n\n\"The Light of Truth\" lecture series\n\nAfter visiting Calcutta, Dayanand's work changed. He began lecturing in Hindi rather than in Sanskrit. Although Sanskrit garnered respect, in Hindi, Dayanand reached a much larger audience. His ideas of reform began to reach the poorest people.\n\nIn Varanasi, after hearing Dayanand speak, a local government official called Jaikishen Das encouraged Dayanand to publish a book about his ideas. From June to September 1874, Dayanand dictated a series of lectures to his scribe, Bhimsen Sharma. The lectures recorded Dayanand's views on a wide range of subjects. They have published in 1875 in Varanasi with the title Satyarth Prakash (\"the light of truth\").\n\nNew samaj\n\nWhile his manuscript for Satyarth Prakash was being edited in Varanasi, Dayanand received an invitation to travel to Bombay. There, he was to debate representatives of the Vallabhacharya sect. On 20 October 1874, Dayanand arrived in Bombay. The debate, though well publicized, never took place. Nonetheless, two members of the Prarthana Samaj approached Dayanand and invited him to speak at one of their gatherings. He did so and was well received. They recognized Dayanand's desire to uplift the Hindu community and protect Hindus from the pressures to convert to Christianity or Islam. Dayanand spent over one month in Bombay and attracted sixty people to his cause. They proposed founding a new samaj with Dayanand's ideas as its spiritual and intellectual basis.\n\nAhmedabad debates\nOn 11 December 1874, Dayanand arrived in Ahmedabad, Gujarat on the invitation of Gopal Hari Deshmukh. There, he debated with interested parties.\n\nRajkot Arya Samaj\n\nOn 31 December 1874, Dayanand arrived in Rajkot, Gujarat, on the invitation of Hargovind Das Dvarkadas, the secretary of the local Prarthana Samaj. He invited topics of discourse from the audience and spoke on eight. Again, Dayanand was well received and the Rajkot group elected to join his cause. The Samaj was renamed Arya Samaj (Society of Nobles). Dayanand published a list of twenty-eight rules and regulations for the followers. After leaving Rajkot, Dayanand went to Ahmedabad but his audience at a meeting on 27 January 1875, did not elect to form a new Arya Samaj. Meanwhile, the Rajkot group had become in a political row.\n\nBombay Arya Samaj\n\nOn his return to Bombay, Dayanand began a membership drive for a local Arya samaj and received one hundred enrollees. \nOn 7 April 1875,Bombay Arya Samaj was established. Dayanand himself enrolled as a member rather than the leader of the Bombay group. The Samaj began to grow.\n\nAfter Dayanand\nDayanand died in 1883. The Arya Samaj continued to grow, especially in Punjab. The early leaders of the Samaj were Pandit Lekh Ram (1858  1897) and Swami Shraddhanand (Mahatma Munshi Ram Vij) (1856  1926). Some authors claim that the activities of the Samaj led to increased antagonism between Muslims and Hindus. Shraddhanand led the Shuddhi movement that aimed to bring Hindus who had converted to other religions back to Hinduism.\n\nIn 1893, the Arya Samaj members of Punjab were divided on the question of vegetarianism. The group that refrained from eating meat were called the \"Mahatma\" group and the other group, the \"Cultured Party\".\n\nIn the early 1900s, the Samaj (or organizations inspired by it such as Jat Pat Todak Mandal) campaigned against caste discrimination. They also campaigned for widow remarriage and women's education. The samaj also established chapters in British colonies with an Indian diaspora such as South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, Suriname, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nProminent Indian Nationalists such as Lala Lajpat Rai belonged to Arya Samaj and were active in its campaigning. Bhagat Singh's grandfather followed Arya Samaj, which had a considerable influence on Bhagat Singh. The British colonial government in the early part of 20th century viewed the Samaj as a political body. Some Samajis in government service were dismissed for belonging to the Samaj\n\nIn the 1930s, when the Hindu Nationalist group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh grew in prominence in Northern India, they found support in the Arya Samaj of Punjab.\n\nArya Samaj in Punjab\nIn Punjab, the Arya Samaj was opposed by the Ahmadiyya movement which provided the Samaj one of its most aggressive opponents from among the various Muslim groups and whose founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was extensively involved in theological disputations with Samaj leaders, most notably with Pandit Lekh Ram. It was also opposed by the Sikh dominated Singh Sabha, the forerunner of the Akali Dal.\n\nArya Samaj in Gujarat\nThe Arya Samaj of Gujarat members were missionaries from Punjab who had been encouraged to move to Gujarat to carry out educational work amongst the untouchable castes by the maharaja, Sayajirao Gaekwad III. The Gujarat Samaj opened orphanages. In 1915, the samaj lost its following to Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nReconversion in Malabar\nIn 1921, during a rebellion by the Muslim Moplah community of Malabar Indian newspapers reported that a number of Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. The Arya Samaj extended its efforts to the region to reconvert these people back to Hinduism through Shuddhi ceremonies.\n\nViews of Orthodox Hindu on the Samaj\nThe then Shankaracharya of Badrinath math in 1939 in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, called Arya Samajis Un-Hindu. He also criticized the samaj efforts at converting Christians and Muslims.\n\nArya Samaj in Hyderabad state\nA branch of Arya Samaj was established at Dharur in Beed district of Hyderabad state, the largest princely state during British colonial rule. Keshav Rao Koratkar was the president of the organization until 1932. During his tenure, the Samaj, established schools and libraries throughout the state. Although a social and religious organization, the Samaj activities assumed a great political role in resisting the government of the Nizam during 1930s. In 1938-1939, Arya Samaj teamed up with the Hindu Mahasabha to resist the Nizam government through Satyagraha. The Nizam government responded by raiding and desecrating Arya samaj mandirs. The Samaj, in turn, criticized Islam and the Islamic rulers of the state. This widely increased the gulf between the Hindu and Muslim population of the state.\n\nLanguage issue\nArya Samaj promoted the use of Hindi in Punjab and discouraged the use of Punjabi. This was a serious point of difference between the Sikhs, represented by the Shiromani Akali Dal group and the Arya Samaj. The difference was marked during the period immediately following the independence of India and the time of the Punjabi Suba movement (demand for a Punjabi speaking state).\n\nHumanitarian efforts\nArya Samaj was a charitable organisation. For example, donations were made to victims of the 1905 Kangra earthquake. The samaj campaigned for women's right to vote, and for the protection of widows.\n\nContemporary Arya Samaj\n\nArya Samaj in India\nArya Samaj schools and temples are found in almost all major cities and as well as in rural areas (esp in North region) of India. Some are authorised to conduct weddings. The Samaj is associated with the Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) schools which number over two hundred. There  are eight  million followers of the samaj in India.\n\nThe former Indian prime minister Charan Singh, as a young man, was a member of Arya Samaj in Ghaziabad.\n\nA branch of Arya Samaj was established in 2015 in Angul district in the state of Odisha\n\nArya Samaj around the world\nArya Samaj is active in countries including Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji, Australia, South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius and other countries where a significant Hindu diaspora is present. The Arya samaj in Kenya runs a number of schools in nairobi and other cities of the country.\n\nImmigrants to Canada and the United States from South Asia, Eastern Africa, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of set up Arya Samaj temples for their respective communities. Most major metropolitan areas of United States have chapters of Arya Samaj.\n\nCore beliefs\n\nMembers of the Arya Samaj believe in one almighty creator referred to with the syllable Aum as mentioned in the Yajur Veda (40:17). They believe the Vedas is an infallible authority. The Arya Samaj members reject other Hindu religious texts because they are not \"revealed\" works. For instance, they believe books like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are legends of historical figures, and rejects them as reference to supreme beings and avatars. The members of Arya Samaj reject other scriptural works such as the Puranas, The Upanishads, the Bible, and the Quran. They reject the worship of idols. The Arya Samaj promotes the equality of all human beings and the empowerment of women.\n\nThe core beliefs of Arya Samaj are postulated below:\n\n The primeval cause of all genuine knowledge and all that is known by means of knowledge is God.\n God is Truth-consciousness \u2013 Bliss personified, Formless, Omnipotent, Just, Merciful, Unborn, Infinite, Unchangeable, Beginningless, Incomparable, Support of all, Lord of all, Omnipresent, Internal, the regulator of all, Undecaying, Immortal, Fearless, Eternal, Holy, and creator of the Universe. He alone deserves worship.\n The Vedas are repositories of all of true knowledge. It is the paramount duty of all Aryas to study and teach and to propound the Veda.\n We should be ever ready to imbibe truth and forsake untruth.\n All acts should be done in accordance with Dharma, i.e. after deliberating upon what is truth and untruth.\n The prime object of Arya Samaj is to do good to the whole world, i.e. to achieve physical, spiritual and social prosperity for all.\n Our conduct towards all should be guided by love, by injunctions of Dharma and according to their respective positions.\n One should dispel ignorance and promote knowledge.\n One should not be content with one's own prosperity only, but should consider the prosperity of all as his own prosperity.\n All human beings should abide by the rules concerning social or everyone's benefit, while everyone should be free to follow any rule beneficial for him/her.\n\nPractices\n\nThe Arya Samaj members consider the Gayatri Mantra, as the most holy mantra and chant it periodically, do the meditation known as \"Sandhya\" and make offering to the holy fire (havan). The havan can be performed with a priest for special occasions or without a priest for personal worship. The havan is performed as per the , usually a simplified guide to do havan, having mantras for general or special occasions. The priest is generally a Vedic scholar from the local Arya Samaj Mandir or Gurukul. Sometimes elder members of family or neighbours can also perform the havan acting as a purohit. The host is known as the \"Yajmana\". The priest can be called an \"Acharya\", \"Swami ji\" or \"Pandit Ji\" depending upon his scholarly status and local reputation. It is customary to give a nominal \"dakshina\" to the priest after havan, although in Arya Samaj it is more symbolic and the priest does not state any sum. The sum is decided by the host's capability and status but is still a small amount.\n\nMembers celebrate Holi (the start of spring) and Diwali (a harvest festival and the victory of good over evil).\n\nArya Samaj advocates a lacto-vegetarian diet and in particular, the eating of beef is strictly prohibited.\n\nAfter a death, Arya Samajis will often conduct a haven and collect the ashes on the fourth day.\n\nDiwali\n\nThe Arya Samaj celebration of Diwali is typified by the celebration in Suriname. The festival celebrates the victory of good over evil. A vegetarian fast is kept. The Gayatri mantra is spoken while oil lamps are lit. One Diya lamp, which is of larger size has two wicks crossed to produce four lights, one in each direction and is lit first. The smaller lamp has one wick. The recitation of the Gayatri mantra occurs in front of a fire altar lit with sandalwood. A lamp is kept in every room except the bathroom and restroom. More lamps can be lit, which can be placed arbitrarily in the yard, living room and so on.\n\nHoli\n\nHoli is celebrated as the conclusion of winter and the start of spring to sow the land and hope for a good harvest. This day is marked by colors and songs (Chautal). It does not require specific prayer or fasting, however, some people keep a vegetarian fast on this day. The Arya Samaj does not associate Holi with a particular deity such as Vishnu or Shiva and in comparison to some interpretations of the festival, the Arya Samaj version in more sober and is as per the 4 Vedas.\n\nSee also\n\nArya Samaj in Fiji\nArya Samaj in Ghana\nArya Samaj in Guyana\nArya Samaj in Kenya\nArya Samaj in Mauritius\nArya Samaj in Mozambique\nArya Samaj in Singapore\nArya Samaj in South Africa\nArya Samaj in Suriname\nArya Samaj in Tanzania\nArya Samaj in Trinidad and Tobago\nArya Samaj in Thailand\nArya Samaj in Uganda\nHindu reform movements\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n Chamupati M.

As McCarthy's chief counsel, Cohn came to be closely associated with McCarthyism and its downfall. He also represented Donald Trump during his early business career.\n\nIn 1986, Cohn was disbarred from the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court for unethical conduct after attempting to defraud a dying client by forcing the client to sign a will amendment leaving him his fortune. Cohn died five weeks later from AIDS-related complications.\n\nEarly life and career\nBorn to an observant Jewish family in the Bronx, New York City, Cohn was the only child of Dora (n\u00e9e Marcus; 1892\u20131967) and Judge Albert C. Cohn (1885\u20131959), who was influential in Democratic Party politics. His great-uncle was Joshua Lionel Cowen, the founder and longtime owner of the Lionel Corporation, a manufacturer of toy trains. Cohn lived in his parents' home until his mother's death, after which he lived in New York, the District of Columbia, and Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAfter attending Horace Mann School and the Fieldston School, and completing studies at Columbia College in 1946, Cohn graduated from Columbia Law School at the age of 20. He had to wait until May 27, 1948, after his 21st birthday, to be admitted to the bar, and he used his family connections to obtain a position in the office of United States Attorney Irving Saypol in Manhattan the day he was admitted.\nOne of the first cases involving him was the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.\n\nAs an Assistant US Attorney in Saypol's Manhattan office, Cohn helped to secure convictions in a number of well-publicized trials of accused Soviet operatives. One of the first began in December 1950 with the prosecution of William Remington, a former Commerce Department employee who had been accused of espionage by KGB defector Elizabeth Bentley. Although an indictment for espionage could not be secured, Remington had denied his longtime membership in the Communist Party USA on two separate occasions and was convicted of perjury in two separate trials.\n\nWhile working in Saypol's office, Cohn also helped prosecute 11 members of the American Communist Party for preaching the violent overthrow of the United States government, under the Smith Act.\n\nRosenberg trial \nCohn played a prominent role in the 1951 espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Cohn's direct examination of Ethel's brother, David Greenglass, produced testimony that was central to the Rosenbergs' conviction and subsequent execution. Greenglass testified that he had given the Rosenbergs classified documents from the Manhattan Project that had been stolen by Klaus Fuchs. Greenglass would later claim that he lied at the trial in order \"to protect himself and his wife, Ruth, and that he was encouraged by the prosecution to do so.\" Cohn always took great pride in the Rosenberg verdict and claimed to have played an even greater part than his public role. He said in his autobiography that his own influence had led to both Chief Prosecutor Saypol and Judge Irving Kaufman being appointed to the case. Cohn further said that Kaufman imposed the death penalty based on his personal recommendation. If the ex parte discussions between a prosecutor and a judge outside the courtroom actually took place, they were improper.\n\nIn 2008, a co-conspirator in the case, Morton Sobell, who had served 18 years in prison, said that Julius spied for the Soviets but that Ethel did not. However, in 2014, five historians who had published on the Rosenberg case wrote that Soviet documents show that \"Ethel Rosenberg hid money and espionage paraphernalia for Julius, served as an intermediary for communications with his Soviet intelligence contacts, provided her personal evaluation of individuals Julius considered recruiting, and was present at meetings with his sources. They also demonstrate that Julius reported to the KGB that Ethel persuaded Ruth Greenglass to travel to New Mexico to recruit David as a spy.\"\n\nThere is a consensus among historians that Julius was guilty, but his and Ethel\u2019s trial was marred by clear judicial and legal improprieties \u2014 many on the part of Cohn \u2014 and that they should not have been executed. Distilling this consensus, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz wrote that the Rosenbergs were \"guilty\u2014and framed\".\n\nWork with Joseph McCarthy \nThe Rosenberg trial brought the 24-year-old Cohn to the attention of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover, who recommended him to Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy hired Cohn as his chief counsel, choosing him over Robert Kennedy. Cohn assisted McCarthy's work for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, becoming known for his aggressive questioning of suspected Communists. Cohn preferred not to hold hearings in open forums, which went well with McCarthy's preference for holding \"executive sessions\" and \"off-the-record\" sessions away from the Capitol in order to minimize public scrutiny and to question witnesses with relative impunity. Cohn was given free rein in pursuit of many investigations, with McCarthy joining in only for the more publicized sessions.\n\nCohn played a major role in McCarthy's anti-Communist hearings. During the Lavender Scare, Cohn and McCarthy attempted to enhance anti-Communist fervor in the country by claiming that Communists overseas had convinced several closeted homosexuals employed by the US federal government to pass on important government secrets in exchange for keeping their sexuality secret. Convinced that the employment of homosexuals was now a threat to national security, President Dwight Eisenhower signed an executive order on April 29, 1953, to ban homosexuals from working in the federal government.\n\nCohn invited his friend G. David Schine, an anti-Communist propagandist, to join McCarthy's staff as a consultant. When Schine was drafted into the US Army in 1953, Cohn made repeated and extensive efforts to procure special treatment for Schine. He contacted military officials from the Secretary of the Army down to Schine's company commander and demanded that Schine be given light duties, extra leave, and exemption from an overseas assignment. At one point, Cohn is reported to have threatened to \"wreck the Army\" if his demands were not met. That conflict, along with McCarthy's claims that there were Communists in the Defense Department, led to the Army\u2013McCarthy hearings of 1954, during which the Army charged Cohn and McCarthy with using improper pressure on Schine's behalf, and McCarthy and Cohn countercharged that the Army was holding Schine \"hostage\" in an attempt to squelch McCarthy's investigations into Communists in the Army. During the hearings, a photograph of Schine was introduced, and Joseph N. Welch, the Army's attorney in the hearings, accused Cohn of doctoring the image to show Schine alone with Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens.\n\nAlthough the findings of the hearings blamed Cohn, rather than McCarthy, they are widely considered an important element of McCarthy's disgrace. After the Army\u2013McCarthy hearings, Cohn resigned from McCarthy's staff and went into private practice.\n\nLegal career in New York \n\nAfter leaving McCarthy, Cohn had a 30-year career as an attorney in New York City. His clients included Donald Trump; New York Yankees baseball club owner George Steinbrenner; Aristotle Onassis; Mafia figures Tony Salerno, Carmine Galante, and John Gotti; Studio 54 owners Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager; the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York; Texas financier and philanthropist Shearn Moody, Jr.; and business owner Richard Dupont. Dupont, then 48, was convicted of aggravated harassment and attempted grand larceny for his extreme attempts at coercing further representation by Cohn for a bogus claim to property ownership in a case against the actual owner of 644 Greenwich Street, Manhattan, where Dupont had operated Big Gym, and from where he had been evicted in January 1979.\n\nCohn was known for his active social life, charitable giving, and combative personality. In the early 1960s he became a board member of the Western Goals Foundation. Although he was registered as a Democrat, Cohn supported most of the Republican presidents of his time and Republicans in major offices across New York. He maintained close ties in conservative political circles, serving as an informal advisor to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Cohn's other clients included retired Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, who has referenced Cohn as \"the quintessential fixer\".\n\nRepresentation of Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch \n\nIn 1971, businessman Donald Trump moved to Manhattan, where he became involved in large construction projects. In 1973, the Justice Department accused him of violating the Fair Housing Act in 39 of his properties. The government alleged that Trump's corporation quoted different rental terms and conditions and made false \"no vacancy\" statements to African Americans for apartments it managed in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.\n\nRepresenting Trump, Cohn filed a countersuit against the government for $100 million, asserting that the charges were \"irresponsible and baseless.\" The countersuit was unsuccessful. Trump settled the charges out of court in 1975, saying he was satisfied that the agreement did not \"compel the Trump organization to accept persons on welfare as tenants unless as qualified as any other tenant.\" The corporation was required to send a bi-weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, a civil rights group, and give the league priority for certain locations. In 1978, the Trump Organization was again in court for violating terms of the 1975 settlement; Cohn called the new charges \"nothing more than a rehash of complaints by a couple of planted malcontents.\" Trump denied the charges.\n\nRupert Murdoch was a client, and Cohn repeatedly pressured President Ronald Reagan to further Murdoch's interests. He is credited with introducing Trump and Murdoch, in the mid-1970s, marking the beginning of what was to be a long, pivotal association between the two.\n\nLionel trains \n\nCohn was the grandnephew of Joshua Lionel Cowen, founder of the Lionel model train company. By 1959, Cowen and his son Lawrence had become involved in a family dispute over control of the company. In October 1959, Cohn and a group of investors stepped in and gained control of the company, having bought 200,000 of the firm's 700,000 shares, which were purchased by his syndicate from the Cowens and on the open market over a three-month period prior to the takeover. Under Cohn's leadership, Lionel was plagued by declining sales, quality-control problems, and huge financial losses. In 1963, Cohn was forced to resign from the company after losing a proxy fight.\n\nLater career and disbarment \n\nCohn aided Roger Stone in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1979\u20131980, helping Stone arrange for John B. Anderson to get the nomination of the Liberal Party of New York, a move that would help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and, as instructed by Cohn, dropped it off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46 percent of the vote. Speaking after the statute of limitations for bribery had expired, Stone said, \"I paid his law firm. Legal fees. I don't know what he did for the money, but whatever it was, the Liberal Party reached its right conclusion out of a matter of principle.\"\n\nFederal investigations during the 1970s and 1980s charged Cohn three times with professional misconduct, including perjury and witness tampering. He was accused in New York of financial improprieties related to city contracts and private investments. He was acquitted of all charges. In 1986, a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court disbarred Cohn for unethical and unprofessional conduct, including misappropriation of clients' funds, lying on a bar application, and pressuring a client to amend his will. In this case in 1975, Cohn entered the hospital room of the dying, comatose Lewis Rosenstiel, the multi-millionaire founder of Schenley Industries; forced a pen to his hand and lifted it to the will in an attempt to make himself and Cathy Frank\u2014Rosenstiel's granddaughter\u2014beneficiaries. The resulting marks were determined in court to be indecipherable and in no way a valid signature.\n\nSexuality \nWhen Cohn brought on G. David Schine as chief consultant to the McCarthy staff, speculation arose that Schine and Cohn had a sexual relationship. Although some historians have concluded the Schine\u2013Cohn friendship was platonic, others state, based on the testimony of friends, that Cohn was gay. During the Army\u2013McCarthy hearings, Cohn denied having any \"special interest\" in Schine or being bound to him \"closer than to the ordinary friend.\" Joseph Welch, the Army's attorney in the hearings, made an apparent reference to Cohn's homosexuality. After asking a witness, at McCarthy's request, if a photo entered as evidence \"came from a pixie\", he defined \"pixie\" as \"a close relative of a fairy\". Though \"pixie\" was a camera-model name at the time, the comparison to \"fairy,\" a derogatory term for a homosexual man, had clear implications. The people at the hearing recognized the slur and found it amusing; Cohn later called the remark \"malicious,\" \"wicked,\" and \"indecent.\"\n\nSpeculation about Cohn's sexuality intensified following his death from AIDS in 1986. In a 2008 article published in The New Yorker, Jeffrey Toobin quotes Roger Stone: \"Roy was not gay. He was a man who liked having sex with men. Gays were weak, effeminate. He always seemed to have these young blond boys around. It just wasn't discussed. He was interested in power and access.\" Stone worked with Cohn beginning with the Reagan campaign during the 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries.\n\nLavender scare \n\nCohn and McCarthy targeted many government officials and cultural figures not only for suspected Communist sympathies, but also for alleged homosexuality. McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of scores of gay men from government employment; and strong-armed many opponents into silence using rumors of their homosexuality. Former U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson has written: \"The so-called 'Red Scare' has been the main focus of most historians of that period of time. A lesser-known element \u2026 and one that harmed far more people was the witch-hunt McCarthy and others conducted against homosexuals.\"\n\nDeath \nIn 1984, Cohn was diagnosed with AIDS and attempted to keep his condition secret while receiving experimental drug treatment. He participated in clinical trials of AZT, a drug initially synthesized to treat cancer but later developed as the first anti-HIV agent for AIDS patients. He insisted to his dying day that his disease was liver cancer. He died on August 2, 1986, in Bethesda, Maryland, of complications from AIDS, at the age of 59. According to Roger Stone, Cohn's \"absolute goal was to die completely broke and owing millions to the IRS. He succeeded in that.\" He was buried in Union Field Cemetery in Queens, New York.\n\nMedia portrayals \nA dramatic and controversial man in life, Cohn inspired many fictional portrayals after his death. Probably the best known is in Tony Kushner's Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes (1991), which portrays Cohn as a closeted, power-hungry hypocrite haunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg as he lies dying of AIDS. In the initial Broadway production, the role was played by Ron Leibman; in the HBO miniseries (2003), Cohn is played by Al Pacino; and in the 2010 Off-Broadway revival by the Signature Theatre Company in Manhattan, the role was reprised by Frank Wood. Nathan Lane played Cohn in the 2017 Royal National Theatre production and the 2018 Broadway production.\n\nCohn is also a character in Kushner's one-act play, G. David Schine in Hell (1996). He is portrayed by James Woods in the biopic Citizen Cohn (1992), by Joe Pantoliano in Robert Kennedy and His Times (1985), by George Wyner in Tail Gunner Joe (1977), and by David Moreland in The X-Files episode \"Travelers\" (1998), in which an elderly former FBI agent speaks to Agent Fox Mulder about the early years of the McCarthy era and the beginning of the X-Files. In the early 1990s, Cohn was one of two subjects of Ron Vawter's one-man show Roy Cohn/Jack Smith; his part was written by Gary Indiana. He was the subject of Matt Tyrnauer's documentary Where's My Roy Cohn? (2019).\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n Roy Cohn's square on the AIDS Memorial Quilt \n\nCategory:1927 births\nCategory:1986 deaths\nCategory:New York (state) lawyers\nCategory:AIDS-related deaths in Maryland\nCategory:American anti-communists\nCategory:20th-century American biographers\nCategory:Columbia Law School alumni\nCategory:Disbarred American lawyers\nCategory:Ethical Culture Fieldston School alumni\nCategory:Gay politicians\nCategory:Horace Mann School alumni\nCategory:Jewish American attorneys\nCategory:Jewish American politicians\nCategory:John Birch Society members\nCategory:Julius and Ethel Rosenberg\nCategory:LGBT businesspeople from the United States\nCategory:LGBT Jews\nCategory:LGBT lawyers\nCategory:LGBT people from New York (state)\nCategory:LGBT politicians from the United States\nCategory:McCarthyism\nCategory:New York (state) Democrats\nCategory:People from Manhattan\nCategory:United States Senate lawyers\nCategory:Business career of Donald Trump\nCategory:Jewish anti-communists\nCategory:Columbia College (New York) alumni", "Gaochang\n\nGaochang (; Old Uyghur: \u0642\u06c7\u0686\u06c7, Qocho), also called Karakhoja, Qara-hoja,  Kara-Khoja, or Karahoja (\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0627\u063a\u0648\u062c\u0627 in Uyghur), is the site of a ruined, ancient oasis city on the northern rim of the inhospitable Taklamakan Desert in present-day Xinjiang, China.  The site is also known in published reports as Chotscho, Khocho, Qocho, or Qo\u010do. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Gaochang was referred to as \"Halahezhuo\" () (Qara-khoja) and Huozhou.\n\nThe ruins are located 30\u00a0km southeast of modern Turpan.  The archaeological remains are just outside the modern town of Gaochang, at a place called Idykut-schari or Idikutschari by local residents. (see the work of Albert Gr\u00fcnwedel in the external links below).  Artistic depictions of the city have been published by Albert von Le Coq.  Gaochang is considered in some sources to have been a \"Chinese colony\", that is, it was located in a region otherwise occupied at the time by West Eurasian peoples.\n\nA busy trading center, it was a stopping point for merchant traders traveling on the Silk Road.  It was destroyed in wars during the 14th century, and old palace ruins and inside and outside cities can still be seen today.\n\nNear Gaochang is another major archeological site: the Astana tombs.\n\nHistory\n\nJushi Kingdom and early Han-Chinese rule\n\nThe earliest people known to have lived in the area were the Gushi (or Jushi). The region around Turfan was described during the Han dynasty  (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE) as being occupied by the J\u016bsh\u012b, while control over the region swayed between the Han-Chinese and the Xiongnu.\n\nGaochang was built in the 1st century BC, it was an important site along the Silk Road. It played a key role as a transportation hub in western China.  The Jushi leaders invited the Chinese Han dynasty to take over and pledged their allegiance.  In 327, the Gaochang Commandery (j\u00f9n) was created by the Former Liang under the Han Chinese ruler Zhang Gui. The Chinese set up a  military colony/garrison and organized the land into multiple divisions. Han Chinese colonists from the Hexi region and the central plains also settled in the region.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Jin Dynasty, northern China split into multiple states, including the Central Asian oases.  Gaochang was ruled by the Former Liang, Former Qin, and Northern Liang as part of a commandery.  In 383 The General Lu Guang of the Former Qin seized control of the region.\n\nIn 439, remnants of the Northern Liang, led by Juqu Wuhui and Juqu Anzhou, fled to Gaochang where they would hold onto power until 460 when they were conquered by the Rouran Khaganate. Another version of this story says that in 439 a man named Ashina led 500 families from Gansu to Gaochang. In 460, the Rouran forced them to move to the Altai. They became the Ashina clan that formed the Gokturk Khaganate\n\nSix Dynasties Turfan tombs contained dumplings.\n\nRouran, Gaoche, and G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk dominance over Gaochang's rulers\n\nFrom the mid-5th century until the mid-7th century, there existed four independent statelets in the narrow Turpan basin.  These were controlled by the Kan clan, Zhang clan, Ma clan, and Qu clan.\n\nA the time of its conquest by the Rouran Khaganate, there were more than ten thousand Han Chinese households in Gaochang.  The Rouran Khaganate, which was based in Mongolia, appointed a Han Chinese named Kan Bozhou to rule as King of Gaochang in 460, and it became a separate vassal kingdom of the Khaganate. Kan was dependent on Rouran backing. Yicheng and Shougui were the last two kings of the Chinese Kan family to rule Gaochang.\n\nAt this time the Gaoche () was rising to challenge power of the Rouran in the Tarim Basin. The Gaoche king Afuzhiluo () killed King Kan Shougui, who was the nephew of Kan Bozhou. and appointed a Han from Dunhuang, named Zhang Mengming (\u5f35\u5b5f\u660e), as his own vassal King of Gaochang. Gaochang thus passed under Gaoche rule.\n\nLater, Zhang Mengming was killed in an uprising by the people of Gaochang and replaced by Ma Ru (). In 501, Ma Ru himself was overthrown and killed, and the people of Gaochang appointed Qu Jia () of Jincheng (in Gansu) as their king. Qu Jia hailed from the Zhong district of Jincheng commandery (\u91d1\u57ce, roughly corresponding to modern day Lanzhou, Gansu) Qu Jia at first pledged allegiance to the Rouran, but the Rouran khaghan was soon killed by the Gaoche, and he had to submit to Gaoche overlordship. During Qu rule, powerful families established marriage ties with each other and dominated the kingdom, they included the Zhang, Fan, Yin, Ma, Shi, and Xin families. Later, when the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks emerged as the supreme power in the region, the Qu dynasty of Gaochang became vassals of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks.\n\nWhile the material civilization of Kucha to its west in this period remained chiefly Indo-Iranian in character, in Goachang it gradually merged into the Tang aesthetics. In 607 the ruler of Gaochang Qu Boya paid tribute to the Sui Dynasty, but his attempt at sinicization provoked a coup which overthrew the Qu ruler.  The Qu family was restored six years later, and the successor Qu Wentai welcomed the Tang pilgrim Xuanzang with great enthusiasm in 629 AD.\n\nThe Kingdom of Gaochang was made out of Han Chinese colonists and ruled by the Han Chinese Qu family which originated from Gansu. Jincheng commandery \u91d1\u57ce (Lanzhou), district of Yuzhong \u6986\u4e2d was the home of the Qu Jia. The Qu family was linked by marriage alliances to the Turks, with a Turk being the grandmother of King Qu Boya's.\n\nTang rule\n\nHowever, fearing Tang expansion, Qu Wentai later formed an alliance with the Western Turks and rebelled against Tang suzerainty. Emperor Taizong sent an army led by General Hou Junji against the kingdom in 640, and Qu Wentai apparently died of shock at news of the approaching army. Gaochang was annexed by the Chinese Tang dynasty and turned into a sub-prefecture of Xizhou (\u897f\u5dde), and the seat of government of Anxi (\u5b89\u897f). Before the Chinese conquered Gaochang, it was an impediment to Chinese access to Tarim and Transoxiania.\n\nUnder Tang rule, Gaochang was inhabited by Chinese, Sogdians, and Tocharians.\n\n7th or 8th century old dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.\n\nTang dynasty became greatly weakened due to the An Lushan Rebellion, and in 755, the Chinese were forced to pull back their soldiers from the region.  The area was first taken by the Tibetans, then finally by the Uyghurs in 803, who called the area Kocho (Qocho).\n\nUyghur Kingdom of Qocho\n\nAfter 840 it then became occupied by remnants of the Uyghur Khaganate fleeing Yenisei Kirghiz invasion of their land.  The Uyghurs established the Kingdom of Qocho (Kara-Khoja) in 850.  The inhabitants of Qocho practiced Buddhism, Manichaeism and Nestorian Christianity.  The Uyghurs converted to Buddhism and sponsored building of temple caves in the nearby Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves where depictions of Uyghur sponsors may be seen.  The Buddhist Uyghur kings, who called themselves idiquts, retained their nomadic lifestyle, residing in Qocho during the winter, but moved to the cooler Bishbalik near Urumchi in the summer.\n\nQocho later became a vassal state of the Kara-Khitans.  However, In 1209, the idiqut Barchuq offered Genghis Khan the suzerainty of his kingdom, and went personally to Genghis Khan with a sizeable tribute when demanded in 1211.  The Uyghurs thus went into the service of the Mongols, who later formed the Yuan Dynasty in China. The Uyghurs became bureaucrats (semu) of the Mongol Empire and their Uyghur script was modified for Mongolian.  As far south as Quanzhou, preponderance of Gaochang Uyghur in Nestorian Christian inscriptions of the Yuan period attests to their importance in the Christian community there.\n\nThe Gaochang area was conquered by the Mongols of the Chagatai Khanate (not part of Yuan Dynasty) from 1275 to 1318 by as many as 120,000 troops.\n\nBuddhism\nBuddhism spread to China from India along the northern branch of the Silk Road predominantly in the 4th and 5th centuries as the Liang rulers were Buddhists. The building of Buddhist grottos probably began during this period. There are clusters close to Gaochang, the largest being the Bezeklik grottos.\n\nGaochang ruling families\n\nRulers of the Kan Family\n\nRulers of the Zhang Family\n\nRulers of the Ma Family\n\nRulers of the Qu Family\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n\nJiaohe Ruins\nFlaming Mountains\nTrade route\n Silk Road transmission of Buddhism\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources \n Bericht \u00fcber arch\u00e4ologische Arbeiten in Idikutschari und Umgebung im Winter 1902-1903 : vol.1\n .\n\nExternal links\n\nAlong the ancient silk routes: Central Asian art from the West Berlin State Museums, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material from Gaochang\n Online version of Albert Gr\u00fcnwedel's initial work in the area\n Online version of Gr\u00fcnwedel's further work in the area\n Online version of Le Coq's work on monuments of Gaochang\n\nCategory:Turpan\nCategory:Former populated places in Xinjiang\nCategory:Populated places along the Silk Road\nCategory:Former countries in Chinese history\nCategory:Oases of China\nCategory:Destroyed cities\nCategory:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Xinjiang\nCategory:Former monarchies of East Asia", "Robert Lloyd (of Rhiwgoch)\n\nRobert Lloyd  was a Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1586 and 1601.\n\nLloyd was the son of Evan Lloyd of Rhiwgoch and his wife Elen Salusbury, daughter of Robert Salusbury of Llanrwst, Denbighshire.

It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, Amaryllis belladonna, is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley and Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result of which is that the common name \"amaryllis\" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus Hippeastrum, widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus Amaryllis are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name \"lily\" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, Lilium. In the Victorian Language of Flowers (see Plant symbolism), amaryllis means \"pride\".\n\nDescription \n\nAmaryllis is a bulbous plant, with each bulb being  in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, green leaves,  long and  broad, arranged in two rows.\n\nEach bulb produces one or two leafless stems 30\u201360\u00a0cm tall, each of which bears a cluster of two to twelve funnel-shaped flowers at their tops. Each flower is  diameter with six tepals (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other). The usual color is white with crimson veins, but pink or purple also occur naturally.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe single genus is in subtribe Amaryllidinae, in the tribe Amaryllideae. The taxonomy of the genus has been controversial. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the name Amaryllis belladonna, the type species of the genus Amaryllis. At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in the same genus; subsequently they were separated into two different genera. The key question is whether Linnaeus's type was a South African plant or a South American plant. If the latter, Amaryllis would be the correct name for the genus Hippeastrum, and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here. Alan W. Meerow et al. have briefly summarized the debate, which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the Atlantic. The outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that Amaryllis L. should be a conserved name (i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African Amaryllis belladonna from the Clifford Herbarium at the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nPhylogeny \nAmaryllidinae are placed within Amaryllideae as follow:\n\nThese are phylogenetically related as follows:\n\nEtymology \nThe name Amaryllis is taken from a shepherdess in Virgil's pastoral Eclogues, (from the Greek  (), meaning \"to sparkle\")  and also from \"Amarella\" for the bitterness of the bulb.\n\nAlthough the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus, the common name \"amaryllis\" continues to be used differently. Bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as \"ready to bloom for the holidays\" belong to the allied genus Hippeastrum. The common name \"naked lady\" used for Amaryllis is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern; some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names, such as the resurrection lily (Lycoris squamigera). The common name \"naked lady\" comes from the plant's pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down.\n\nHabitat \nIn areas of its native habitat with mountainous fynbos flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth.  In more open sandy areas of the Western Cape, the plant flowers annually. Plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds' large size and heavy weight.  Strong winds shake loose the seeds, which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate, aided by the first winter rains.\n\nEcology \nThe leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. The plant is not frost-tolerant, nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production.\n\nOne or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer (March in its native habitat and August in USDA zone 7).\n\nThe plant has a symbiotic relationship with carpenter bees.  It is also visited by noctuid moths at night.   The relative importance of these animals as pollinators has not yet been established; however, Carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the Cape Peninsula. The plant's main parasite is the lily borer Brithys crini and/or Diaphone eumela.\n\nCultivation\n\nAmaryllis belladonna was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century. It reproduces slowly by either bulb division or seeds and has gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the West Coast of the USA since these environments mimic their native South African habitat. Hardiness zones 6-8. It is also naturalized in Australia.\n\nThere is an Amaryllis belladonna hybrid which was bred in the 1800s in Australia. No one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white, cream, peach, magenta and nearly red hues. The hybrids were crossed back onto the original Amaryllis belladonna and with each other to produce naturally seed-bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes, shapes, stem heights and intensities of pink. Pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well. The hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes, veining, darkened edges, white centers and light yellow centers, also setting them apart from the original light pink. In addition, the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the \"side-facing\" habit of the \"old-fashioned\" pink. The hybrids are able to adapt to year-round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be.\n\nA.\u00a0belladonna has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nAmaryllis belladonna has been crossed in cultivation with Crinum moorei to produce a hybrid called \u00d7\u00a0Amarcrinum, which has named cultivars. Hybrids said to be between Amaryllis belladonna and Brunsvigia josephinae have been called \u00d7\u00a0Amarygia. Neither hybrid genus name is accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n \n \n\nCategory:Amaryllidoideae\nCategory:Amaryllidaceae genera\nCategory:Christmas plants\nCategory:Garden plants of Africa\nCategory:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus", "Souvenir de Hapsal\n\nSouvenir de Hapsal, Op. 2, is a suite of three pieces for piano by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.  It was his first cycle of piano pieces and it was composed in 1867.\n\nHistory\nThe Souvenir de Hapsal was written during Tchaikovsky's stay in Hapsal, then in the Russian Empire (it is now Haapsalu in Estonia). He stayed there with his brothers Modest and Anatoly Tchaikovsky as well as members of the Davydov family.

It finds an envy-free item assignment of a subset of the items. Moreover, the resulting allocation is Pareto efficient in the following sense: there is no other envy-free allocation which is better for one person and not worse for the other person.\n\nThe AL procedure was first published by Brams and Kilgour and Klamler.\nIt was later generalized by Haris Aziz to handle the case where agents may express indifferences.\n\nAssumptions \nThe AL procedure requires the following assumptions on the people:\n Each person can rank the items from best to worst (i.e., each person can report a strict preference relation on the items).\n Each person has a preference relation on bundles of items which is compatible with the responsive set extension of the ordering on items.\n\nRequirements \nIt is not assumed that the people can report their preference relation on bundles. There are many bundles, and it may be difficult to report a ranking on all of them.\n\nTherefore, the procedure should return an allocation that is envy-free for every preference relation that is consistent with the item ranking and with weak additivity. In other words, the procedure should return an allocation that is necessarily envy-free (NEF).\n\nSuppose the two people are Alice and George. An allocation is NEF for Alice if there is an injection f from George's items to Alice's items, such that for each item x received by George, Alice prefers f(x) to x. An allocation is NEF for George if the symmetric property is satisfied. An item assignment is NEF if it is NEF for both partners. Note that in a NEF assignment, Alice and George receive the same number of items.\n\nThe empty allocation is obviously NEF, but it is very inefficient. Therefore, we are looking for an allocation that is \"best\" among all NEF allocations. A NEF allocation is called Pareto-efficient if there is no other NEF allocation that is better for one person and not worse for the other one.\n\nThe BT procedure \nAs an introduction, consider the following simple division procedure:\n\n Put all items on the table.\n While there are items on the table, do:\n Ask the partners to choose their favorite item from all items on the table.\n If the choices are different, then give each partner his/her favorite item and continue.\n If the choices are identical, then send the chosen item to the Contested Pile. It will not be allocated.\n\nThis procedure returns a NEF allocation. It is very simple but not very efficient, since many items are discarded to the contested pile. The AL procedure is slightly more complicated, but it guarantees that the contested pile is never larger, and may be smaller than under BT.\n\nThe AL procedure \nThe AL procedure works similarly to the BT procedure, but, before moving an item to the contested pile, it tries to allocate it to one partner while compensating the other partner with another item. Only if this doesn't succeed, the item is sent to the contested pile.\n\nFor example, suppose there are four items (1, 2, 3, 4) and the preferences of the partners are:\n Alice: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4\n George: 2 > 3 > 4 > 1\n\nThe BT procedure gives 1 to Alice and 2 to George, since these are their favorites and they are different. Then, both Alice and George choose 3 so it is discarded. Then, both choose 4 so it is also discarded. The final allocation is: Alice\u2190{1}, George\u2190{2}. It is NEF but not PE.\n\nThe AL procedure also starts by giving 1 to Alice and 2 to George. Then, instead of discarding item 3, it is given to Alice, and George is compensated with item 4. The final allocation is: Alice\u00a0\u2190\u00a0{1,3}, George\u00a0\u2190\u00a0{2,4}. It is NEF and PE.\n\nBoth procedures are manipulable: a partner can gain by reporting incorrect preferences. However, such manipulation requires knowledge of the other partner's preferences, so it is difficult in practice.\n\nThe AL procedure with indifferences \nThe original AL procedure crucially relies on the assumption that the item rankings are strict.\n\n generalizes this procedure to general rankings, with possible indifferences.\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:Fair division protocols\nCategory:Game theory\nCategory:Mathematical optimization\nCategory:Pareto efficiency", "Mike Feuer\n\nMichael Nelson Feuer (born May 14, 1958) is an American politician and lawyer who has been serving as Los Angeles City Attorney since July, 2013, after defeating incumbent City Attorney Carmen Trutanich on May 21, 2013.\n\nFeuer was previously elected to three two-year terms in the California State Assembly, representing the 42nd Assembly District.

He later served on the Harvard Law School Visiting Committee, which reports to the Harvard Board of Overseers.  He practiced law at two of California's leading firms and served as a judicial clerk to the California Supreme Court.\n\nFeuer served as executive director of Bet Tzedek Legal Services - The House of Justice. The Los Angeles Daily Journal declared that Feuer transformed Bet Tzedek into a \"national success story\" by establishing programs to help Alzheimer's patients, victims of the Northridge earthquake and L.A. civil unrest, and Holocaust survivors striving to obtain restitution.  At Bet Tzedek, Feuer oversaw free legal representation for more than 50,000 elderly, poor, and disabled clients on issues including health care, nursing home abuse, consumer fraud, and slum housing.\n\nCity Council\nFrom 1995 to 2001, Feuer served as the 5th District member of the Los Angeles City Council. He was elected to fill a vacancy caused by the election of Councilmember Zev Yaroslavsky to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Feuer defeated Barbara Yaroslavsky, the outgoing councilmember's wife.\n\nWhile on the Council, Feuer led committees on business tax reform, children's and seniors' issues, and ethics in government. He chaired the City Council's Budget and Finance Committee, delivering balanced multibillion-dollar budgets and intervening to ensure meals and transportation for seniors in need, jobs for disadvantaged youth, basic services for Los Angeles' neighborhoods and funding to promote literacy.\n\nFeuer reached the two-term limit for his city council seat in 2001, and ran for city attorney.\n\nFirst run for City Attorney and after\nIn 2001, Feuer ran for City Attorney.

Afterward, Feuer worked in private practice and taught at the UCLA School of Public Affairs.  He also wrote articles on children, seniors, government reform, violence prevention, consumer rights, the justice system and the environment in California's leading newspapers.  He served as a commentator on National Public Radio member KPCC.\n\nRace for Assembly\nIn 2006, Feuer defeated West Hollywood Mayor Abbe Land and three others in the Democratic primary for the 42nd Assembly District seat.\n\nFeuer won the general election against Republican Steven Mark Sion with more than 72% of the vote. In 2008 he was reelected, defeating Sion again with more than 76% of the vote. He was elected to a third and final term in the Assembly in 2010, defeating Republican Mary Toman-Miller with more than 73% of the vote.\n\nAssembly Member\nFeuer served as a member of the California State Assembly, 42nd District, from December 4, 2006 - November 30, 2012. He served as the Majority Policy Leader of the California Assembly and Chair of the Assembly's Judiciary Committee, writing laws on gun violence prevention and public safety, the environment, justice reform, LGBTQ equality, protecting seniors and homeowners, healthcare, transportation and voter registration. These include, among others:\n\nAB 1471: Enacted in 2007, this required that all new handgun models manufactured in California be equipped with \u201cmicrostamping\u201d technology, which allows law enforcement to match cartridge cases found at a crime scene to the gun\u2019s owner.\n\nAB 2244: Enacted in 2010, this implements and phases-in several provisions of the federal healthcare legislation including prohibiting health plans from denying coverage to children with pre-existing health conditions. It also bans health insurers from selling policies to anyone for five years if they refuse to sell policies for children.\n\nAB 91:\u00a0 Enacted in 2010 as a pilot program, this aimed to reduce drunk driving by requiring DUI offenders to install ignition interlock devices (IID\u2019s) in their cars. \n\nAB 215: Enacted in 2011, this requires nursing homes to post the quality care rating that has been given to them by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This gives families information they can use in deciding how to care for loved ones. \n\nAB 2321: Facilitated Measure R appearing on the ballot in November, 2008, to raise $40-million for transportation projects.\n\nAB 1879: Enacted in 2008 as part of California\u2019s Green Chemistry Program, this gives the California Environmental Protection Agency greater authority to regulate toxins in consumer products. It would accomplish this by convening an advisory panel of scientists to guide research in chemical policy, establishing regulation for assessing alternatives, and setting up a database of research on toxins.\n\nAB 1436: Signed in 2012, this aimed to make it easier to vote in California by allowing voters to register up to and on Election Day. \n\nAB 590: Referred to as the Sargent Shriver Civil Counsel Act, this was enacted in 2011 as a pilot program to assure equal justice by providing free legal representation to low-income Californians.

Promotes tax equality by requesting that the IRS defer to California law on treatment of community property belonging to registered domestic partners and same-sex spouses.\n\nAB 329: Enacted in 2010, the Reverse Mortgage Elder Protection Act protects seniors by giving them more information when considering reverse mortgages, including risks and alternatives to utilizing them.\n\nLos Angeles City Attorney \nFeuer took office as the 8th Los Angeles City Attorney on July 1, 2013. He was re-elected in 2017 without opposition.  Since taking Office Feuer has nearly tripled the Neighborhood Prosecutor Program, launched a broad neighborhood school safety initiative, formed a strike force to combat illegal dumping, taken on wage theft, tackled substandard housing, cracked down on homless patient dumping, closed more than half the City's unlawful medical marijuana dispensaries, instituted a program to protect immigrants from fraud, advanced environmental justice and, in the wake of the Parkland shooting, created the Blue Ribbon Panel on School Safety to evaluate and recommend ways to enhance efforts by Los Angeles Unified School District to keep students safe from violence, particularly gun violence, both in schools and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nIn April 2018 Feuer won a major court victory against the Trump administration winning an injunction against the Federal Government they can't tie funding immigration considerations.\n\nIn 2017, the American Bar Association Government and Public Sector Lawyers Division awarded the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office with the Hodson Award, which recognizes sustained outstanding performance or specific and extraordinary service by a government or public sector law office.\n\nFeuer's work to protect consumers caught national attention as he was the first governmental entity to go after Wells Fargo for opening unauthorized accounts. His litigation resulted in a national settlement with Wells Fargo, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Comptroller of the Currency. He has also sued the Weather Channel App over data privacy concerns, vape companies alleging that they target children and H&R Block and Intuit, the makers of Turbo Tax, alleging the companies defrauded low-income taxpayers and charged them for a service that the companies are required by law to provide for free.\n\nTo prevent gun violence, Feuer created the Gun Violence Prevention Unit in his office and has worked to keep guns out the hands of criminals and children.  Feuer has brought charges against parents who did not properly store firearms which later fell into the hands of their children.  Working with the LAPD, he created protocols to assure domestic violence perpetrators do not have weapons. He has also advocated for the use of gun violence restraining orders, leading educational trainings after the law passed in California in 2016. \u00a0 In a national effort, Feuer joined with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. to co-found and chair Prosecutors Against Gun Violence\u2014an independent, non-partisan coalition devoted to prosecutorial and policy solutions to the public health and safety crisis of gun violence.\n\nTo reform the justice system and help reduce recidivism and addresses the root causes of crime, Feuer created the Community Justice Initiative\u2014an array of innovative, neighborhood-based programs addressing quality of life crimes, truancy, prostitution, the needs of homeless veterans and more.\n\nFeuer also has played a role in solving municipal problems, including the settlement of L.A.'s decades-long dispute with the Owens Valley (saving the city millions of dollars and vast quantities of water), and a successful fight for transparency in how ratepayer dollars are spent by DWP trusts.\n\nProsecution of Black activists\n\nFeuer's office has filed charges against numerous prominent Black activists after their arrests during Los Angeles Police Commission meetings. These include Los Angeles' only homeless elected official \"General\" Jeff Page, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder and Cal State LA professor Melina Abdullah, and longtime civil and human rights activist and labor organizer Greg Akili. Akili, a member of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles\u2019 Action Committee and a cofounder of the United Domestic Workers Union, filed a $4 million lawsuit in 2017 against the City of Los Angeles, the LAPD, and others regarding his arrest at a 2016 Commission meeting and subsequent prosecution. Akili called his trial, in which he was found guilty of resisting arrest but the misdemeanor battery charge against him was dismissed after a jury with no Black members deadlocked, \"an effort to silence Black Lives Matter\", and said Feuer could have avoided the \"political trial\" by dropping the charges against him. Akili's attorney, Dermot Givens, said the battery charge against Akili was dropped because Feuer \"didn\u2019t coordinate the lies good enough.\"\n\nPersonal life\nFeuer holds both a bachelor's degree and a law degree from Harvard University, and has been married to California Court of Appeal Justice Gail Ruderman Feuer for over 34 years, with two children: Danielle and Aaron.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nCategory:Los Angeles City Attorneys\nCategory:Members of the California State Assembly\nCategory:Jewish American politicians\nCategory:1958 births\nCategory:Harvard Law School alumni\nCategory:Los Angeles City Council members\nCategory:California Democrats\nCategory:California lawyers\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:21st-century American politicians", "Kazimierz \u017beromski\n\nKazimierz Chwalib\u00f3w \u017beromski (died 1662) was Pu\u0142kownik of Lithuanian forces during the Battle of Kushliki, where he defeated the first assault of Prince Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky.\n\nReferences\n\n Zawistowski, W.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs prohibited arts training, but the wife of the superintendent of the school, Elizabeth Willis DeHuff, invited Herrera and his fellow students Fred Kabotie, Otis Polelonema, and Awa Tsireh to paint in her living room. DeHuff's painting groups have been described as a seminal event in the development of the Southwest Movement of Native American painting. The work of DeHuff's students were displayed at the Museum of New Mexico in 1919 and museum director Edgar Lee Hewett hired Herrera and other artists for various jobs at the museum and for the School of American Research. Herrera said, \"Dr. Hewett selected a few he thought had talent and started us to painting. I was one. I have been painting ever since.\"\n\nFollowing the exhibition at the Museum of New Mexico, press coverage promoted their work and the next year they were included in the annual exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York. Herrera's work was widely exhibited in the US and Europe and included in the Exposition of Tribal Indian Arts traveling show (1931\u201333). He and five other artists were commissioned to paint 2200 feet of murals for the Main Interior Building of the US Department of the Interior in Washington, DC. Herrera's work included detailed, representational depictions of Pueblo life, including ceremonial kachina dances, and abstract works based on Pueblo symbolism. The work of Herrera and other Native American artists was not always viewed positively in their native communities, especially when it came to depictions of restricted ceremonies. Herrera was eventually ostracized by Pueblo elders.\n\nHerrera's illustrative work included educational materials for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He illustrated a number of books for author Ruth Underhill. In My Mother's House, a book that he illustrated for Bureau of Indian Affairs author Ann Nolan Clark, was named a Caldecott Honor book in 1942.\n\nIn 1954, he was awarded the French Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques. He largely abandoned painting after being seriously injured in a car accident, which also killed his wife.\n\nNotes\n1.The St. James Guide to Native North American Artists reports the date of death as January 30, while Oxford Art Online reports it as January 18.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Velino Herrera at the Koshare Indian Museum\n Velino Herrera at the Smithsonian American Art Museum\n \n\n \n\nCategory:1902 births\nCategory:1973 deaths\nCategory:Native American painters\nCategory:Painters from New Mexico\nCategory:People from Sandoval County, New Mexico\nCategory:Place of death missing\nCategory:20th-century American painters\nCategory:American male painters\nCategory:People of the New Deal arts projects\nCategory:Recipients of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques\nCategory:Pueblo people\nCategory:Native American illustrators", "Dean Godson\n\nDean Godson is the Director of the London-based think tank Policy Exchange.\n\nIn 2016, the Evening Standard named Godson one of London's most influential people, saying that \u201cFiercely bright Godson, formerly chief leader writer at the Daily Telegraph, has been described as Britain\u2019s acknowledged expert on the problem of social cohesion.\u201d Commentator Iain Dale also named Godson as one of the 100 most influential people on the right of British politics, in his annual rankings in 2016 , 2017 and 2018.\n\nEducation\n\nGodson was educated at three independent schools for boys: at Edinburgh Academy preparatory school, while his father was US Consul General in Scotland, Sussex House School in Cadogan Square in Chelsea, London and St Paul's School in Barnes, London, followed by Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge from which he graduated with a second\nclass degree (receiving a 2-2 in part I and a 2-1 in part II).\n\nLife and career\nDuring the 1980s, Godson was Research Assistant to Sir Ray Whitney, MP for Wycombe. He also held the position of Assistant to Hon John Lehman, US Secretary of the Navy, Washington DC, and was a Research Fellow at both Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, Cambridge, Massachusetts and the Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies. From 1990\u201392, Godson worked as Librarian to Sir James Goldsmith.\n\nFrom 1992\u20131995, he worked for The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph as an obituary writer, leader writer and feature writer. From 1995\u20132004, he was Chief Leader Writer of The Daily Telegraph, writing largely about mainland domestic politics and Northern Ireland. From 1997\u20132004, he also worked as Associate Editor of The Spectator under Boris Johnson\u2019s editorship (before the latter became Mayor for London), was a Contributing Editor for Prospect magazine and a Consultant Editor on the New York Sun.\n\nIn his political career, Godson stood as candidate in Great Grimsby in 1997 and served as first Deputy Chairman of Kensington and Chelsea Conservative Association from 1995\u201398.\n\nGodson is author of Himself Alone: David Trimble and the Ordeal of Unionism (Harper Collins, 2004) which was short listed for the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize. Andrew Marr called it \"a great act of political reporting \u2013 instant history, if you like \u2013 about the drama of Northern Ireland's search for peace\". He was a visiting Professor at the University of Ulster.\n\nWork at Policy Exchange\n\nGodson joined Policy Exchange in 2005 and initially headed up its research into security policy, before becoming its Director in 2013.\n\nIn 2005, Godson edited Replacing the Routemaster: how to undo Ken Livingstone's destruction of London's best ever bus. The study, which featured contributions from Colin Cramphorn, Simon Jenkins, Andrew Gilligan and many others, was the first major critique of Ken Livingstone's policy of scrapping the Routemaster bus. The report heavily influenced Boris Johnson's subsequent 'New Routemaster' policy in the 2008 London Mayoral elections. and was attacked by outgoing Labour mayor Ken Livingstone in his memoirs.\n\nGodson founded the Colin Cramphorn Memorial Lecture, to celebrate the life of the late Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The inaugural lecture was delivered by Peter Clarke, then head of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command. In 2009, the lecture was delivered by Charles Farr, Director General of the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism in the Home Office. In September 2009, it was delivered by General David Petraeus, then Commander, United States Central Command.\n\nIn 2011, Gen James N. Mattis, then head of CENTCOM, gave the sixth Colin Cramphorn Memorial Lecture.\n\nAs head of Policy Exchange's security unit, Godson produced a number of reports examining the views of British Muslims. This included, in 2009, \"Choosing Our Friends Wisely: Criteria for Engagement with Muslim Groups\u201d by the ex Hizb ut-Tahrir radical Shiraz Maher and Dr Martyn Frampton of Peterhouse, Cambridge. The report was praised by Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, former Chief of the Defence Staff, as \"remarkable\".\n\nIn June 2011, columnist Matthew D\u2019Ancona wrote in the Evening Standard that the Government's review of its counter-terrorist strategy was \u201ca tribute to an intellectual battle fought over the years by the modernising think tank, Policy Exchange... and, specifically, the head of its foreign policy and security unit, Dean Godson\u201d.\n\nIn October 2007, Policy Exchange published a report entitled The Hijacking of British Islam: How extremist literature is subverting mosques in the UK. Godson became embroiled in controversy when Newsnight put out a broadcast on 12 December 2007 that suggested some of the receipts purporting to prove the sale of extremist material had been forged, and that some of the material had come from bookshops purportedly unconnected to the mosques named in the report.\n\nPolicy Exchange's rebuttal maintained that the receipts were not mentioned in the report, and that the report's findings were not dependent on them. On 15 August 2008, The Independent reported that two mosques mentioned in the report, the Al-Manar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre and the North London Central Mosque, were preparing to take legal action against the Policy Exchange. Subsequently, the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, following a clarification but no apology from Policy Exchange, withdrew its threatened legal complaint.\n\nOn 26 November 2009, Mr Justice Eady struck out the claim brought against Policy Exchange by the North London Central Mosque. The six mosque trustees who had advanced the claim were ordered to pay Policy Exchange's costs of defending the action. The High Court made a further Order that \u00a375,000 of those costs be paid by the North London Central Mosque within 28 days.\n\nGodson's work on combating extremism was praised in a speech in 2014 by the then UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, calling it \u201cincredibly important\u201d and stating it \u201chas had a huge influence\u201d.\n\nIn April 2017, Godson published a lengthy article on the ConservativeHome website, setting out Policy Exchange's call for evidence on the contingency plans needed in the event that the UK is unable to secure a deal with the EU when it leaves the bloc.  ConservativeHome's editor, Paul Goodman,  called this \u201ca thought-provoking list of questions... Policy Exchange is early out of the traps seeking answers\u201d.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n Policy Exchange Profile\n The Godson Approach to Political Warfare\n Dean Godson of Policy Exchange grilled by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight\n\nCategory:Year of birth missing (living people)\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:British male journalists\nCategory:British magazine editors\nCategory:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge\nCategory:People educated at St Paul's School, London", "Partula bilineata\n\n\u2020Partula bilineata was a species of air-breathing tropical land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Partulidae.\n\nDistribution\nThis species was endemic to Taha'a, French Polynesia.
